 GPT-3, the large language model underlying ChatGPT, is certainly an impressive piece of language processing software. But that's all it is. ChatGPT is not intended to be an artificial intelligence, although it may give some people the initial impression that it has some intelligence.
 ChatGPT generates plausible text, consistent with its training data and input, but it doesn't know what it's talking about, and it has no way of representing or evaluating the truth of its utterances. Yes, it can say true things, but it can also say complete nonsense, and it can't tell the difference.
 ChatGPT does not attempt to make truthful or even logical statements. Its job is to create ""completions"" of the text you feed it. It's ultimately doing the same kind of tasks as the spelling-checker and word suggestion feature supplied with modern phone keyboards, except that it's working with deeper and broader linguistic structures.
 It has no problems making grammatically correct utterances with no spelling errors, and those utterances are linguistically consistent with the input you feed it and its training data. But it's only operating on linguistic structure, it is oblivious to the underlying logic and truth value of the statements it makes. It may emit text which is logically valid and true, but that's just a fortunate side-effect of the linguistic structure and its training data. In extended passages, it can easily say things that are logically inconsistent. And it has no way to evaluate how relevant its utterances are to the input data, apart from the linguistic consistency. So when it says true and useful things that's just a lucky coincidence.
 ChatGPT often makes stupid errors of logic and silly arithmetic errors. OTOH, we have theorem-proving AI that can handle complex logic, and sophisticated mathematical systems that can do arithmetic, algebra, and calculus. In the future, we will surely have natural language software that can handle logic and mathematics, but the current incarnation of ChatGPT won't magically gain those abilities merely by throwing more training data at it.

People have already voted on whether the proposed solutions were helpful to them or not; the top answer on one of them has 442 upvotes and 1 downvote, so I already know that hundreds of humans have reviewed the answer for correctness.
 You got one ChatGPT answer that no one else had reviewed but that just happened to be correct (and that's not always the case); in the same amount of time, I got 40 answers to choose from (all of them reviewed by other humans before, in many cases hundreds of times).
 Imagine what would've happened if ChatGPT's answer hadn't been correct; what would you do then - ask it the same question and hope for a different answer? Or just post a Stack Overflow question instead?
 You can downvote a bad Stack Overflow answer or comment asking for clarification, but there's no recourse for a bad ChatGPT answer.

VonC didn't ignore 29,184 questions. I could keep going with this, but the point is the vast majority of people become high-rep by answering lots of questions.

6243352,,48817,"I've been using ChatGPT to answer programming questions for weeks. Unless I've been manipulating it poorly, quite simply, ChatGPT takes a great deal of prodding and pleading to get a complete, correct response from, when a correct response is achievable at all. It's a tool, basically a jacked-up autocomplete that's wrong, say, more than half the time.
 For example, here's some code it wrote for an extremely trivial programming task, finding the minimum element in an enumerable in Elixir:
 def find_smallest(numbers) do
  Enum.min(numbers)
 end
 
 Fine and well. I asked it to translate this code to Dart and it provided this wrong answer[1]:
 
 To solve the problem of finding the smallest number in a list in Dart, you can use the min function from the dart:math library.
 Here is an example of how you could implement the find_smallest function in Dart:
 import 'dart:math';
 
 int findSmallest(List<int> numbers) {
  return numbers.min();
 }
 
 You can then use the expect function from the package:test library to write test cases for the function.
 [bunch of test cases that the function fails on]
 
 This is the sort of plausible-looking ChatGPT-based answer you'd see flooding Stack Overflow before the ban.
 I'm not a Dart programmer, so after this failed, I looked it up on SO to find the human solution. This isn't an isolated incident. It's the typical workflow using ChatGPT at the present time.
 There's no doubt that it's an amazing piece of technology that's correct some of the time. It's helped me quickly solve certain problems over the past few weeks. I don't doubt that it solved the problem you mentioned for you. When successful, it's magic. The problem is, it reveals itself as unreliable once you put it through the ringer on a variety of problems. I'm not talking about 80% accuracy, from what I've seen, more like 40% accuracy.
 
 But technology is advancing and we are becoming more and more independent of human skill to find solutions to programming challenges
 
 Not really. Human skill is just as important as ever. Nowadays, one needs to be extremely judicious about separating fact from fiction and separating plausible-looking solutions from truly correct ones.
 Unless large strides are made soon, ChatGPT is nowhere near replacing Stack Overflow or programmers in general any more than self-driving mode will be replacing human drivers.

 Here is an answer from ChatGPT itself:
 
 While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering a wide range of
 questions, Stack Overflow still serves a valuable purpose as a
 community-driven platform for technical Q&A. Rather than replacing
 Stack Overflow, ChatGPT could be used in conjunction with the site to
 provide additional support and guidance for users.
 One possibility would be to integrate ChatGPT's capabilities into
 Stack Overflow's existing interface, allowing users to ask questions
 in a conversational format and receive instant responses. This could
 potentially help users who are struggling to formulate their questions
 or who are looking for guidance on how to approach a particular
 problem.
 However, it's important to consider the potential drawbacks of such an
 approach, such as the risk of information overload or the possibility
 of inaccurate or incomplete responses. Ultimately, any changes to
 Stack Overflow should be carefully evaluated to ensure that they align
 with the site's goals of providing accurate, high-quality technical
 information to users",-12,0,,ChatGPTBetter_ans,0.076190476

 What to do? Stack Overflow should include provision for people to post their questions and answers from ChatGPT. These could be commented upon, and voted up or down as with any post or its replies
 Doing this would: 1) benefit the community (instead of remaining private), 2) provide corroboration, correction, and refinement for the poster, and 3) give ChatGPT more knowledge to digest. In this way, we harness the incredible power of ChatGPT, help it improve, and keep the real source of knowledge --which comes from humans-- from drying up.",-17,0,,ChatGPTBetter_ans,0.240784832

1887645,,7709,"For GPT3 or ChatGPT3.5 I would not have agreed, but for ChatGPT4 and for programming tasks (in my case mostly in R and Python) and the field I work in (biostatistics) I agree. Using ChatGPT4, the answers that come out are for me generally more or less on a par with the quality of an average SO answer, and perhaps even similar to the quality of the currently best accepted answers on Stack Overflow. Here some concrete examples. For example, it was able to answer a 5 year old highly rated question that I awarded several bonuses for, producing working OpenGL+SDL code called via the rdyncall package (which is currently not even on CRAN). Or based on a verbal description of a biological problem (that had not been solved in the academic literature before) ChatGPT4 inferred how to correctly write this as a differential equation system and it was also happy to make further modifications to put in extra biological parameters, and then fired up Wolfram Alpha to determine the long-term equilibrium. Here the question plus part of the answer.
 
 
 The answer to this question (reproduced almost verbatim from ChatGPT4, but with output of the ChatGPT R code included & maths verified to be correct) was also better than any of the other available answers.
 On Cross Validated / Stats Stackexchange only 8 out of my 20 questions I asked were ever answered (with an answer that I accepted) - 3 of which by myself. That's only a success rate of 25% to get useful help from others that solved my original problem. If I paste the unanswered questions into ChatGPT4 I would count about 83% as useful & largely or entirely correct (i.e. I would have given them a checkmark, whereas the current answers are either beating about the bush, not solving my original problem or are plain wrong & for some there is no answer at all).
 Sometimes it takes a bit of prodding to get things right, but so does getting a correct answer on Stack Overflow - that also usually still requires prodding other users posting answers and telling them ""no, I would like this or that instead"" or ""your solution is not working because xxx"" etc. I would say that most of the info on ChatGPT here on SO is (1) factually incorrect, (2) highly outdated & referring to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4 and (3) extremely opinionated. For example, this article citing the poor maths capabilities of ChatGPT applies to ChatGPT3.5, not ChatGPT4, which can now use the Wolfram Alpha plugin and according to recent benchmarks in fact excels at math. And with the use of the ScholarAI & browser plugin it can also give sources. Sure, anything that comes out needs checking. But most current Stack Overflow answers could also use a thorough check & a lot of edits.
 So I would see good scope for AI and humans to work together to tilt our capabilities to a new level & get good answers for more questions here on SO. But of course with appropriate guardrails in place to prevent abuse. And mainly in the context of programming related questions, where I would then require reproducible code and output or benchmarks plus citation of a credible source & disclosure of the use of ChatGPT or Github Copilot if it was used, to make sure that any answers are actually correct. I would also not accept plain copy & paste answers. Nowadays most of us will probably be at least inspired by GPT when answering any question really.

 Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that the only place with a standard high enough to train an effective LLM on, would be hated on by the users of the LLM.
 
 If you sort by new and unanswered questions on SO, you will see just exactly why there are strict rules on asking questions.
 
 SO is not for your minor uncertainty or first attempt at solving a problem. The amount of questions ""answered"" by an OP themselves moments later with some ""Nevermind, I forgot to add a closing bracket"" is staggering.
 
 What people here are interpreting as arrogance and malicious intent is experienced users taking their time to answer people's questions freely.
 
 You SHOULD be hesitant to ask a question on SO.
 
 That means you will first try all you can to search for an actual answer, to actually frame your questioning. I cannot count how many times I have found something to try out that have solved my issues just my thoroughly structuring my question.
 
 For newbie questions or quick feedback, use ""learn programming"" or ""programmingquestions"" on reddit, IRC or discord. THAT is the purpose of those tools.
 
 The purpose of SO is in no way, shape or form that.
 
 It is for high quality answered, to high quality questions.
 
 ""why does my conda environment fail on my home computer, but works on my job"" type questions is not high quality. Especially when 50 other users have asked pretty much the same question in the last week, only with some specifics to their own setup. 
 
 It is a local and isolated question that can only be answered in a local and isolated context.
 
 If you framed the same question, with with cross referenced chiseled out error messages, included possible similar issues from doing some research, with a focused description of what it is you fail to understand, THEN users would be able to actually help you.
 
 SO is NOT the place to go to for casual help on something we are to lazy to look into or solve ourselves. And that is the power of SO. 
 
 Asking low quality unstructured questions have to be discredited in order to keep both questions and answers in a high enough quality for an LLM to be able to use it. 
 
 With out the gatekeeping of low quality questions, the quality of answers will dry up. 
 
 Without the quality answers to quality questions on SO, the quality of LLM's will dry up, as an LLM is not able to actually answer anything, but only reference the most useful previously answered question in the context.",4,0,2023-07-27T09:30:25.000Z,Reddit_Comments,0.045842322

jtq3ic3,itsdr00,,"&gt;When I do that I've given page/video views/ad impressions to those blogs, magazines, Wikipedia etc.
 
 Not to be pedantic, but I have to wonder how many of the people who are upset about this issue also use adblockers. Because I imagine it's a huge proportion. And it's not because they're hypocrites; I resisted using adblockers for years because of the ethics of obtaining information for free that someone else paid to collect and display. But I use an adblocker now because the internet is *absolute garbage.* [This article](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/) calls what's happened ""enshitification,"" and I think it explains why people are so head-over-heels eager to use ChatGPT. Finding information online has been miserable for years, and we finally have effective relief.
 
 Let's say no-one regulates what OpenAI and its competitors have done. It happened and it's over. All the shitty websites that dangled information you wanted behind 500 words of filler to keep you on the page while blasting you with ads shut down. Also, a lot of reasonably good websites that were creating valuable information (which was then being reposted by a mountain of shitty ones) go down with them. There's suddenly no way to learn new things on the internet; all we have is what AI knows and what you can ask a human, plus donation-based sites like Wikipedia that will probably never shut down, even though their traffic declined.
 
 What do AI companies need, now? Information. And what do they have to do? Pay for it. Research, journalism on that research, solutions to weird tech problems, community discussions, etc. There's suddenly a market for unanswered questions. I don't know if anyone can say exactly what that looks like, but I know one thing: AI companies will pay for what once was paid for with ads. And my friend, I can't tell you how much nicer that's going to be. The internet does not need to be shitty. We can do better than this.",1,0,2023-07-27T22:09:21.000Z,Reddit_Comments,0.067604618

Then we went to this wild distributed model, where information was coming from so many places that you couldn't do any kind of purchase or subscription model anymore. You can't expect people to subscribe to the individual google results they're getting back, right? So it went to advertising. I think we're going to see a reversal of that, back to silos (as you pointed out, we're already seeing it with Discord/etc). Except now, your Encyclopedia has 1000x as much information in it and it talks to you and teaches you things.

jtqy79z,itsdr00,,"Google can't charge a subscription because it makes money by delivering ads on webpages, not its search site. Outside of sponsored links, you see almost zero advertisements on Google itself. They tried doing a subscription for the distributed ad model, but [it didn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Contributor), I would guess because it didn't have wide enough participation and couldn't compete with ad blocker, anyway. All that is to say, a subscription to Google would have no additional value, because the ads aren't on Google. It would just feel like price gouging at this point.
 
 The comparison really starts to break down when you look at cost-per-user. Searches are dirt cheap. AI is crushingly expensive. You just can't make that much ad revenue per user. If GPT4-quality AI is available at search-engine prices, we might see ad-supported AI, but even then they'd still take a subscription payment. Why? Because it'd make way more money per-user, and unlike a search engine, it would actually add value. That's why Hulu does it: People will pay for it.
 
 &gt;(where even if one product is better, the other options are good enough that many people won't want to pay for the better one).

2752520,,,"I was reading this post extensively and I'm really worried by the reactions.
 The first thing I remembered was cab driver's reaction when Uber came to my town. They reacted extremely angrily. They got together, persecuted Uber drivers. They used lawfare and political connections against Uber drivers, and they got to physical fights with Uber drivers to the point Uber drivers initially couldn't reveal themselves when they picked up a client because cab drivers where constantly looking for them and picking fights with them and their clients.
 This scenery lasted a couple of months until they realized the inevitability of their fate. Some cab corporations even tried to educate cab drivers to give candies and treat client the best way possible. Nothing could resist Uber and today there are very few cab drivers resisting in my town.
 Now when I read this thread I notice some very worrying trends:
 First the level of ChatGPT answers on this matter (most upvoted answers) just shows how advanced it is. The sarcastic answer was terrifying.
 Second, I saw that most people see the ban as the correct option, without having a reasonable way of distinguishing AI-generated answers from human answers. I think there are only two possible ways: letting users decide if it's an AI generated answer or having direct help from OpenAI itself. But I really don't think that humans will have the ability to tell one from the other. That leaves us with the only option of asking OpenAI for help. Has anyone contacted them yet?
 Then the level of harshness with those who advocated ChatGPT integration (most downvoted answers) only reinforced the memory of cab drivers reaction. This worries me the most because disruptive technologies have to be embraced from the start or things will only get worse.
 Adding to this is a very compelling pro-AI factor: the fact that some users are really fed up with aggressive answers from humans in SO and would much rather prefer to interact with a AI that treated them good. This is getting so critical that some people left SO altogether. I live in Brazil and I don't use the Portuguese SO because of extreme rudeness I got there several times. English SO is less bad, but I can assure you that if there were any other options people would embrace them in a heartbeat.
 Just like I and many other people were fed up by cab drivers unethical attitudes like trying to figure out if the users knew the town so they could make a longer paths to the destination, not giving correct change, rudeness and many other things. That made Uber irresistible. As soon as it was available I never ever used a cab again. Since the first day it was on town.
 Finally, remember that ChatGPT is learning and its answers will only get better and better. What are wrong or bad answers now will probably be the best answers in the future.
 My advice (which will make my answer quickly get to most downvoted): If we can't get OpenAI to help, integration with ChatGPT is the only possible option. Create a clearly labeled automated answer for each post from ChatGPT and let users downvote it if it's bad as with any normal user.
 This way users will have an immediate answer they know was AI generated and they will know there is a greater risk of being wrong, just like we know with automated translations of text.
 I know this will be unpopular because it will make more difficult to build reputation points, especially if ChatGPT improves its answers. It's still better than losing all SO or making fruitless attempts to differentiate AI answers from human answers.
 Any other option will not stand this test.
 Maybe this means that some time in the near future SO will be no longer relevant because you can just ask an AI what the problem is with no need for human interaction. Well, if that is the case SO is already doomed and needs to rethink its business model from the scratch. If that's the case, it's better to embrace it as soon as possible. Humans can always help with comments and corrections at least while it still generates wrong or bad answers. But if it gets really good at it, there is no possible future for SO.

12299000,,,"Use of ChatGPT generated text for content on Stack Overflow is temporarily banned.
 
 Something worth clarifying, I think, is that although most of the discussion here has centred around answers written by ChatGPT, the statement of the ban also applies to questions, and I think that is good - questions written by ChatGPT, or especially questions with code written by ChatGPT, should be banned, even when the user does not try to pass them off as their own writing.
 If somebody asks a question like ""I used ChatGPT to generate this code, but it doesn't work, why not?"", then generally the correct answer will be ""because ChatGPT wrote it, and ChatGPT shouldn't be expected to write correct code."" It is not useful for questions along these lines on Stack Overflow to get more detailed answers than that, because other readers probably aren't interested in why that exact code someone else got from ChatGPT is broken. So such questions ought to be closed.
 Likewise, questions where especially beginner programmers post a problem (e.g. from their homework or a textbook) and ask how to solve it are often asked to show their own attempt in the question. If an asker tries to get around this by showing an ""attempt"" written by ChatGPT, that is not sufficient to make for a good question. The reason we ask to see an attempt is because otherwise there is no way to know what level of understanding an answer should be tailored to, and an ""attempt"" by ChatGPT doesn't address this.",22,0,16-03-2023 0.26,Temp_policy_ans,0.19375

 But this is only the beginning.
 You are at the same point that chess players were when computer engines entered the board and started to play chess at a human level.
 Chess adapted to engines, and Stack Overflow should adapt to AI coding systems, perhaps develop its own AI system (they have the site content to train its project; they could open it as an account subject to human democracy).
 A few decades later, the chess engines have an Elo rating of 3300, while Magnus Carlsen is rated 2900, so there will come a day when users will prefer to ask their code problems from an AI rather than a human (maybe soon). This will rid the site of bad questions that are not well-received and not answered. It will also help the site to evaluate its own content to detect errors (perhaps adding a warning: ""The AI has detected a problem in this answer"").
 There still are chess players who would prefer that there weren't any engines, but by now chess engines have become friends of most chess players.
 The AI coding systems should also become a friend of the community of programmers.

 I agree to most other answers, except the ""but there is no solution"" part. Also, I believe not all posters here understand that we're just at the beginning.
 Hence, my proposal would be to attack, instead of defend.
 Why not enable a feature that sends all questions to ChatGPT right after posting and display the result alongside the answer? It should be marked as the ChatGPT answer and users could opt to not display it.
 
 This would immediately stop people from abusing ChatGPT to farm reputation. The similarity would be too obvious, at least for the case where the question is just copy-pasted. If ChatGPT users enhance the question to improve the response, they already added some value and would not be in rapid fire mode anymore.
 
 It would give the benefit of the doubt that an AI answer might actually be valuable.
 By rating those answers the same way as rating human answers, we can see how they rank with others.
 
 Humans who write answers can refer to it and agree or disagree, if that makes any sense. They can point out whether there is only a minor mistake in the AI answer or whether the answer is based on a misunderstanding or predominant misconception on the internet (as the source of information).

616460,,,"Additional cases for permanent ban of answers
 In addition to completely agreeing with this for all the reasons already stated in the other answers, and also feeling like it should be permanent (also for reasons stated many times elsewhere), I think there is an additional case for making it a permanent ban that I don't see covered elsewhere:
 Under the presumption that anybody can just go to a public GPT instance, type their question, and get a similar (if not identical) answer, then allowing those answers to be posted on SE sites essentially means two things:
 
 It means, to some extent, that the question itself lacked research: If it was that easy to get an answer (ask a bot) then the asker probably could have done that. In some SE communities this is fine, but for communities where lack of research is generally frowned upon, allowing these answers to be posted essentially encourages questions that the community does not generally want.
 
 More importantly, it means that the Q/A pair is, for all intents and purposes, simply a bot's chat log. If I can ask the bot a question and get an answer, then I put that question and answer on an SE site, all I've really done is duplicate information that already exists on the internet. While certain SE sites definitely have their share of duplicate information (e.g. SO has a lot of questions whose answers can be found in documentation), it's still generally of no value to add additional duplication, especially when that information is just a copy of a Q/A session that can be had with a given GPT bot at any time. Duplicating logs of chats with bots doesn't really add any value to the internet. SE ultimately serves the purpose of getting knowledge out of small groups of peoples' heads and into large groups of peoples' heads, but this just duplicates what's already out there.
 
 
 Therefore, because encouraging questions that communities don't want is obviously undesirable, and because duplicating logs of chats with bots doesn't really add any value anywhere, I think the ban should be permanent. In addition, of course, to all the other reasons given.
 
 PS Furthering the above two points: These bots are trained on existing information, and as such they're not really creating new information. They're effectively just search engines that present reorganizations of existing information in the form of readable text. So asking them a question is roughly equivalent to Googling for a question and interpreting the results. In my opinion, bots should be treated with the same attitude as search engines are treated. And answers from bots should be treated the same as answers that are just copy+pasted Google results (i.e. valueless plagiarism).",26,0,26-12-2022 17.58,Temp_policy_ans,0.097569573
9779559,,,"Banning all ChatGPT answers is a good temporary move, as it opens a time window where it could be discussed thoroughly, but it, IMO, shouldn't be permanent, as it could also help if used according to its capabilities and by acknowledging its limitations.
 Consider the following situation:
 Someone sees a question they know the answer to.
 They don't want to worry about the structure of the answer, so they use ChatGPT with a prompt that directs it towards the correct answer of the problem (for example, if the question is ""How do I remove and get the last element of an array?"", a possible prompt might be ""Using the array.pop method, write a StackÂ Overflow answer to the question ...""
 They then check and verify the answer to see if ChatGPT has done any mistakes, and either direct ChatGPT to correct the answer, or correct it themselves.
 They then post the answer.
 Is this helpful to SO? I would assume it is as the user who asked their question gets an answer that works, and the answerer spends less time formulating and explaining the answer and more time worrying about the correctness of the answer. As ChatGPT is a language model, here it would have been used correctly according to its capabilities (language and not programming - the programming knowledge comes from the answerer).
 Should this be banned permanently? Permanently banning all ChatGPT answers means this should be banned as well, even though it actually is helpful to the Q&A format we have going on here.

 in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.
 
 Why set out to determine it 'is actually bad' instead of good. In my experience, it's usually correct (because I ask the right questions). In the cases it's not, it's useful to discuss with ChatGPT where the mistake lies. With some frequency I ask it to reread its reply and whether it is sure that's correct.
 Similar in many comments, where people clearly show bias without supporting or even convincing arguments. Comments like ""it is stupid"" and ""it's a good joke generator"". The main argument seems to be ""it's not always correct"". Yes, neither are all (or even most?) human answers, but that aside, if that's your main argument, what will you do in 6 months or 2 years?
 Personally I think ChatGPT is hands down the most productive assistant / near-coworker I ever had (in 30+ years IT and coding) and anyone not adapting it ASAP to gain at least experience with it is contributing to their own demise.
 Important to understand is that it's an assistant, a tool, not a substitute. AI won't replace developers; developers who use AI will replace developers. Pick a side that suits you and your family. Sticking your head in the sand isn't a fruitful approach to AI, embrace it, control it, use it to increase productivity.
 Posting answers or questions written by ChatGPT straight to SO is like copying and pasting from another site, but banning questions and answers ChatGPT assisted in writing just seems wrong. It's almost like banning a spell/grammar checker.
 I learned never to complain without offering alternatives. People posting answers should be held accountable for bad answers. That way they'll put in the extra effort to make sure the AI-assistant answer is useful to the one asking the question.

 The future of AI in a different timeline
 The current banhammer stopgap may work for now, but it's a simple solution requiring manpower, and it won't be viable forever. Who here remembers when Dragon Naturally Speaking came out on CD in the 90s? I was 8 or 9 when my grandfather got us a copy. We had an old beige microphone, and my friends and family were absolutely amazed at the speech recognition capability. They could dictate documents directly into Microsoft Works, and I could.... Well... Do what 9-year-olds do best: See how many curse words it could recognize... Even if you had to enunciate them.
 Fast forward a couple of years and the same software could recognize multiple individuals in a single conversation and create a transcript including respective speakers. Fast forward a few more years and Microsoft has added ""Train your computer to better understand you""1, so enunciation is no longer an obstacle.
 That 10-year timespan I just covered would be easy to react to as a community. The problem is AI doesn't take 10 years, it takes 10 hours2. It's easy to spot right now (question rephrased to statement followed by bullet points for your vanilla ChatGPT) but what happens when we get the option to ""Train your computer to better type like you""? The Insider Build of Windows 11 (Dev Channel) currently has a Copilot preview that can access your active tab3. I'm certain Microsoft Office access will be next, so It's only a few steps away at most in my opinion.
 My opinion moving forward
 My thought is this... The banhammer on AI-generated content that isn't cited should continue. However, we should move towards a system that accepts it, so long as it's clearly marked/cited as machine generated4Â and there should rarely, if ever, be a top answer marked that is wholly AI-generated. As we move towards that system, the 30-day bans need to turn into 90-day bans. If we incorporate automated detection at some point, it should be human-reviewed, and 90 days should turn into 180 days. I do not see this as too harsh of a punishment so long as users have been explicitly warned.
 I believe that if history (as a whole) has shown us anything, it's that we cannot simply ignore a problem, sweep it under the run, and expect it to go away. Band-aids are temporary, but AI is not. Humans have suppressed so many different things over the years... Catholics persecuted Presbyterians as heretics in the Middle Ages, Americans in the land of the free bought and sold black slaves to tend their households and farmlands, women were expected to quietly obey their husbands without a voice to vote until the 1900s, and Jews... Well, Jews have gotten the shaft since the dawn of time.
 I'm not saying that AI deserves citizenship or human rights[5]. But as widespread as AI will inevitably become, and as integrated into our lives as it will we need to treat it that way.
 TLDR:
 We should standardize a boilerplate for AI content and require anyone incorporating it into their content to use it. We should continue the 30-day ban stopgap until a point where it's no longer needed. We should work towards a way of automating the recognition of AI-generated content that isn't cited, always require human review of this automation's output to reduce false positives and implement very steep consequences for those who violate the rules.
 Again, all of this is just my opinion. I've been a lurker for 7 years, but as you can see from my reputation, I haven't been active until this past week (I've started to enjoy teaching and tutoring in IT). So, in the grand scheme of things, my 2 cents is literally just that, 2 cents. But I hope that at least a few of you will share somewhat similar opinions. Thanks for your time :)
 Clarification on long-term viability and manpower
 I do not necessarily think there will be a need to patrol AI-generated content forever. At least, I hope there isn't... However, dumping everything into implementing 30-day bans as stopgaps can't be the answer. Because if we're relying on humans to recognize AI-generated content, we will fail no matter what. I'm not necessarily saying we should absolutely do anything specific. I'm only saying that we need to look much further ahead than much of the discussion going on here.
 I do not know what technology drives Stack Exchange on the backend. But the technology has to move forward to account for AI content. Whether you call this a forum, a wiki, an image board, a social media network, or anything else... The technology underneath needs to move forward. To stress this point again if we're relying on humans to recognize AI-generated content, we're going to fail no matter what
 What's stopping users from simply not adding the boilerplate?
 As Stack Overflow is built on a foundation of user trust, there's nothing that can be done to prevent this except moderating content. Though, in my opinion, adding the boilerplate at least lets the userbase know it's expected. I found out via a comment warning when skimming through questions.
 But AI content can't reliably be detected?
 I'm not asking for someone to look into this or share information related to site analytics or any other privileged information. However, I would postulate that greater than 65% of users who have been banned for posting AI generated content are newer users trying to boost their reputation. Furthermore, I would estimate that greater than 80% of those are using a vanilla ChatGPT based AI, of which greater than 95% are ""non-precise"" style (This high percentage is based on the difficulty of getting a reliable output to open ended questions.)
 I want to point out an assumption in my argument. I'm looking at this from the point of view that if you know enough about AI to use anything outside of what's available on the mainstream channels, you likely have the experience to answer the questions without using AI content or to examine the content for accuracy before posting it. As mentioned in the previous section, I am basing this assumption off the foundation of trust.
 If those numbers are remotely close, then the additional review queue should not require much additional overhead to patrol a large portion of violations. I can quite easily imagine a natural language string analysis algorithm combined with a user event timing algorithm that could pick out a relatively high percentage of violations. I'm sure there are many users way more talented than myself who could imagine the same in a far more optimized and efficient way.
 An alternative
 If patrolling content and review queues are too far-fetched, then maybe instead of targeting users, we should target posts (I thought this was mentioned in one of the comment threads, but I couldn't find it on a second look). Automated boilerplate addition to user posts if they are flagged as AI generated by an algorithm. A certain reputation level allows an individual to remove the boilerplate. A higher reputation level will automatically bypass the check on their posts.
 
 If policing content isn't the answer, then decriminalization and regulation is.

 First of all, I fully agree with the temporary policy, and I am in favor that it becomes a ""permanent temporary"" one.
 The main reason I'm on that opinion is not the fact of the tool being available, but the way so many people were using it: as a copy-pastable BS generator for social networking engagement (in our case, SO reputation). This alone spawns several reasons for why it should be banned, but I don't have to point them out anymore, as it should be common knowledge right now.
 I am not in favour of computer-aided code writing as a tool to show examples of how a particular question can be solved. That is a job for GitHub Copilot or other places, not for this website. People can go straight to GPT-3's playground and ask the program to write code for them as an additional reference, but Stack Overflow should remain as human-aided different points of view in a given problem in the form of a question.
 
 On the other hand,
 
  (here comes the downvoting...) xD
 
 I would like to add to the debate ""legitimate"" use of the technology. Consider some people who are savvy on the topic of the community (in our case, programming), but they are not proficient in the use of English or in a general sense, for whatever reason, haven't developed very good communication abilities.
 Would you consider the potential contributions of such a person less valuable than another one who can express themselves ""better"" (in the sense of getting their point across close to the most optimal possible way)?
 Now take the conclusion you've reached by reading the last two paragraphs and let's see what professionals of the marketing area are doing. They're using ChatGPT as a tool for computer-aided writing. Sure, the lazy ones are just copying and pasting whatever the program spits out, but in the hands of a capable professional, ChatGPT is much more powerful and is faster than hours of googling, which is what they were doing until now.
 Also, that is what we programmers were doing until now. Of course, our main sources of inspiration are probably Stack Overflow, but there's a lot of forums around. Just like ServerÂ Fault users rely mostly on Server Fault, but the ArchWiki is still a reliable curated source of information, among other wikis and forums. But we all became dependent on search engines like Google Search.
 Come to think about it, it came as no particular surprise to me that Microsoft decided to integrate ChatGPT into the Bing search engine.
 There is a specific ELI5 prompt on the ChatGPT API examples page that try to show how to use the power of synthetic dialectics to further clarify a subject. The job of a communicator is to find the best words in the best order to exchange an idea to a specific target group. And in that field, ChatGPT is not a terrific tool, but it can aid many people as it is right now.
 
 My point is that computer-assisted writing is a beneficial thing. People can use it to write better questions primarily, but also improve their answers' wording. This is specially useful for the handful of people I've described earlier: the ones proficient in programming, but not as much in writing English, or in communicating in general.
 The distinction between computer-assisted writing and copy pasting from a BS generator should be obvious.
 I could send this whole answer to proof reading humans or ChatGPT and bet excellent feedback from the humans, but reasonable good feedback from the program. It would look less like I'm the author of it, but in both cases, you, the reader, would struggle less to understand what I want to tell you. DISCLAIMER: I did neither. This is 100% my first take on writing the answer, without revision.
 Finally, my opinion is that people should somehow feel that it's ok to use computer programs to aid their writing. I'm not sure how the anti GPT policy could be further improved to include this, or if is it even necessary.
 I will repeat this paragraph from the beginning, now that the reader has a new perspective:

4188092,,,"Prediction: SO will eventually incorporate AI trained on correct answers to clear questions.
 ================================================
 Well, after all the down-votes and comments as if I had set a date for the end of the world, I noticed today, 15/09/2023, SO is now selectively offering its alpha OverflowAI search feature.
 I expect that SO's use of AI will soon get into the answers side of things.
 ================================================
 If it doesn't, the AI of Bing, Google or Baidu will make SO obsolete due to it being too slow to get answers to questions.
 Of course, what is 'correct' in the training data needs to be truly correct, and not just what the OP decided among the early answers, as later answers may be more comprehensive or nuanced.
 Raw SO answers would be poor training for AI because most answers are just not good enough or misleading, let alone the masses of unhelpful comments. The problem with AI is that it needs an eclectic and massive tranche of correct and accurate data for its training so that it is not going to be polluted too much by subsequent real-life data. SO is in a very good position to have its own AI, as it would not be sweeping up irrelevant or incorrect data that search engine AI would be incorporating now.
 The role of moderators would shift to being more about checking the training data and AI answers than policing question quality, as language AI would easily pick up ambiguous phrasing and respond with suggestions, correct them, or flag for human attention.
 Also, the increase in SO moderators aggressively closing newbie questions or commenters making snarky comments too often may just force more to go to AI answers. Popularity is relative to the help offered. Not providing help but insults instead will hurt SO when it is up against AI that is far more forgiving regarding the 'quality' of questions. See The Tyrannical Mods of Stack Overflow for some examples, including some where even popularity didn't save them.
 I know tech experts and mods on SO don't want to be customer service reps, but that really needs to be part of the role, otherwise the more forgiving AI will eat all SO's meals before it gets to see them.
 We have so many free programming tools these days with documentation that is often unhelpful. Not everyone is building Apollo guidance systems, so do not need to know all the ins and outs of their language, but just want to get the task at hand done. Stifling a poor question instead of helping them work through their issue is going to kill SO for them. But that is a labour-intensive process, which is where AI could significantly alleviate the load by interactively converging on a result, or at least clarify the question.
 SO has the opportunity to step up and meet the challenge of AI, or close off, and become irrelevant. The window of opportunity is rapidly closing!
 Response to comments
 
 Aggressively enforcing rules without taking the time to educate new users is what alienates new users.
 
 Competent AI is NOT way in the future. ChatGPT was only released less than a year ago, and few were expecting it to do what it does, so I would expect capacity and competence to increase rapidly now that such AI is being put front and centre in search engines.
 
 'Why would we even have persistent AI answers at a future point when they can just be generated on demand as good as expert answers?' - that is exactly the existential question for SO posed by AI. The competency of AI can increase very rapidly with the right training, so unless SO adapts to the disruption posed by AI, it will be irrelevant, just because the current model is so heavily reliant upon competent human attention and a huge portfolio of loosely-structured Q&A decided by a popularity contest among those whose own competency is decided by a popularity contest. Populist 'truth' does not make for good AI processing!
 
 Yes, some user and mods may not want to have to be like customer service reps, and so might be happy to have ChatGPT et al be the first point of call, but the big question is whether there will be enough users after that for SO to be viable enough to satisfy what Prosus expected of it when they bought it for $1.8b in 2021. Too few users and they will just have to write it off like many formerly popular sites before it.
 
 
 When AI is given facts to prioritise upon (like BNF statements for programming languages) and training effort is made to avoid irrelevancies, the current SO paradigm will seem slow and archaic by comparison.
 I don't say AI is going to be a universal panacea, but in the realm of sifting knowledge given an intended goal, its speed will trounce everything else that purports to be authoritative but is still essentially based upon hearsay, SO included.
 SO will always be behind the 8-ball in getting its data up to standard given the amount of ad-hoc queries and its maxim that popularity is a reliable indicator of truth and accuracy. There is not enough unbiased humans to do that job.
 Generative AI will not tend to find novel solutions to questions, but at least it does catch a lot of obvious coding errors and can make suggestions based on previous solutions. SO has been losing queries to the likes of ChatGPT, so ignoring its advantages would be folly on SO's part. They are using AI now, and are in a unique position to optimise what results are used to train their own AI. If AI helps take a load off of moderators, in a productive way, they should go for it. For some mods, that may be a challenge, but after all, they are volunteers with no voting rights when it comes to using AI.
 Some have decried the incidence of wrong answers from AI, or that code may be insecure. Well, SO is based solely upon what the OP decides is the best answer, and everything else is a popularity contest. Nowhere is accuracy or security guaranteed by SO, because it is not feasible to do so, just because using people to do it doesn't scale. However, using AI to find the obvious errors will, like most computer-assisted technologies, up the lower end of answers, perhaps providing feedback as they are typed.",-49,0,17-02-2023 4.28,Temp_policy_ans,0.123283404

1121352,,,"TL;DR
 Even from the point of view of AIÂ researchers, Stack Overflow and other sites with mostly human generated content should ban or force labelling of AI generated content, as otherwise this will cause a circular reasoning catastrophic failure as the newly generated content past year 2022 cannot be fed to train newer AIÂ models anymore since we can't know what was generated by humans or by older AIÂ models.
 Longer argument
 I would like to provide an alternative perspective, not from the standpoint of Stack Overflow human users, but from Artificial Intelligence researchers.
 It's highly likely that GPT-3 and hence ChatGPT was trained on all of Stack Overflow data. This worked because all the inputs at the time was human generated. (PS: Let's put aside the discussion whether it's ethical for AI researchers to use 3rd-party content to train AIÂ models without asking the respective owners - I am here focusing on the fact that it already happened, that this cannot be undone, and the impact on our current and future situation).
 Now, if answers from humans are mixed with answers generated by AI, we get a tampered dataset that will be unusable to train future LLM or other language models, because it will cause a hugely flawed circular reasoning loop, as we now feed an AI model data that an older AI model generated, without being able to determine what was generated by humans or by AI.
 This means that if we can't ensure that most answers remain generated by humans, this will lead to a catastrophic failure of AI models, as it will simply become impossible to use newer data to make newer models: 2022 will become an ""event horizon for AI"" , with data generated prior to this year being still usable for training, but any data generated past being mostly unusable because of being tainted potentially in great proportions by AI generated content.
 So this issue is not even just specific to Stack Overflow: all websites should either ban the use of AIÂ generated content, or force such content to be labelled as AIÂ generated. But even so, it will only work with compliant users. Since there is no 100% reliable way to detect textual AI generated content, and given we can always expect people to game the system especially when there are incentives to do so, this catastrophic failure seems all but inevitable.",15,0,26-01-2023 6.37,Temp_policy_ans,-0.025627706

19104886,,,"The more I use ChatGPT, the more I agree with this policy. I asked it ""Can you explain the difference classes of amateur radio licenses?"", and it said this:
 
 There are three classes of amateur radio licenses in the United States: Technician, General, and Extra. Each class of license has its own set of privileges and requirements.
 The Technician class license is the entry-level license for amateur radio operators. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies above 30 megahertz, including the very popular 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands. Technician licensees are not allowed to use the HF (high-frequency) bands, which are the bands used for long-distance communication.
 The General class license is the intermediate level license. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies, including the HF bands. General class licensees are also allowed to use higher-power transmitters and to operate certain types of equipment that are not available to Technician licensees.
 The Extra class license is the highest level of amateur radio license. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies, including the HF bands, and to use the highest power levels allowed by law. Extra class licensees are also allowed to use a wider range of equipment and to operate in certain types of specialized modes, such as digital modes and satellite communications.
 To obtain an amateur radio license, an individual must pass a written examination administered by a team of volunteer examiners. The examination covers the rules and regulations governing the operation of amateur radio stations, as well as basic concepts in electronics and radio theory. The level of difficulty of the examination increases with each class of license, with the Extra class license being the most difficult to obtain.
 
 This seemingly very well-written answer is wrong in several ways.
 
 Technician licensees are allowed to use certain small parts of some HF bands, with restrictions.
 General licensees can use large portions of all bands, but there are Extra-only frequencies within many of the bands.
 On VHF and higher bands, all licensees have exactly the same privileges. General licensees being able to use higher power than Technicians is true on HF bands, but it is not universally true.
 Extra licensees have the same power limits General licensees do.
 Virtually any transceiver that an Extra can use can also be used by a General licensee.
 Even Technicians can use digital modes and satellites. All licensees can use all modes; they're just limited to certain frequencies.

 All things are temporary. The ban should stay for as long as it is needed.
 
 The artificial replies cannot be trusted.
 
 We are seeing good and bad answers. There are many bad answers just now, but AI progress is rapid. They may be a valuable tool quite soon. Not in a hundred years? They are better than they were last week.
 Quality is an issue, but it is not the whole issue. We should not invite AI replies once their quality equals our human contributors. We should exclude them until we understand what their replies are, and the nature of their failings.
 
 We cannot tell whether a reply is from AI or not.
 
 This is true. If we can tell the difference, then the AI can be trained to see the difference and correct for it. Some people may take ChatGPT answers and post them as their own. Others may post replies from their own model to test it, and to gather training data. A simple filter, such as limiting the reply time to a typical typing speed, may stop us getting swamped. But it won't last.

 Limitations
 ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL training, thereâ€™s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.

5196093,,,"A key thing to understand here is that the question is not, as some have suggested in the comments, whether any AI model can produce correct code. It's whether this one can be trusted to do so.
 The answer to that question is an unqualified ""NO"". GPT-3 is a language model. Language models are an essential part of tools like automatic translators; they tell us how probable it is that any given sentence is a valid English (or whatever language) sentence written as a native speaker would1, which lets us favor translations that are idiomatic over ones that just translate individual words without considering how the sentence flows. The systems can be trivially modified to generate text, if instead of looking up the word you have in the probability distribution it provides, you instead select the next word according to that distribution, which is how these chat bots work.
 Because the goal is to produce output that looks like native English text, the models are trained to assign high probabilities to existing text samples, and evaluated based on how well they predict other (previously unseen) samples. Which, for a language model, is a fine objective function. It will favor models that produce syntactically correct text, use common idioms over semantically similar but uncommon phrases, don't shift topics too often, etc. Some level of actual understanding does exist in these models2, but it's on the level of knowing that two words or phrases have similar meanings, or that certain parts of a paragraph relate to each other. There is understanding, but no capacity for reasoning.
 Correctness will tend to increase the score, insofar as correct answers are somewhat more likely to appear in the training data than any particular incorrect answer (there might be more wrong answers overall, but the probability mass will be distributed amongst the various classes of wrong answer instead of concentrated in one region of semantic space like it is for the correct one), but this is a side-effect of trying to look like common text. If you have a question for which there is a commonly held false belief or an answer that can be constructed out of common idioms and otherwise excellent grammar, the model is quite likely to report those instead of the real answer, because semantic correctness is not what a language model is trained for.
 Trying to use a language model to generate code is like trying to use a submarine to fly to the moon. That's not what it's for; why are you trying to use it for that? Stop doing that.
 But at the same time, arguing that the submarine is bad at flying is rather missing the point. Nobody who actually understands NLP is claiming otherwise.3
 There do exist systems that are designed to produce code, and trained to optimize correctness. (e.g. Genetic Programming). That's a bit too far outside my area of expertise for me to make any claims as to where the state of the art is on those, so I'm not sure whether answers generated by them should be allowed or not. But if you were to use an AI tool to generate code, that's the sort of thing you should be looking at; they're designed for the task. Similarly, you could ask if language models could be used as a tool to edit questions you've written by hand, perhaps to check the grammar or recommend new ways to phrase answers so they flow better. They'd be fairly good at that sort of thing (probably. I haven't used any of those tools myself (the rambling, stream-of-consciousness answer might have given that away), but the math supports the idea that they should work4). Translation is another task where (similar) systems work fairly well. (Machine translations still aren't perfect, but they're much better than they were 10 years ago, and improvement in language models is a big part of that.) Just always be aware of what tool you're using, and whether it's the right one for the job.
 
 1 More formally, it gives the probability that a uniformly randomly selected English sentence of a specific length would be this one, but that gives the same ordering over sentences as long as we make some fairly reasonable assumptions.

 I've seen a lot of its interactions on Twitter recently, and some of them have been generally fun to watch and interesting to observe. In some contexts it could actually be beneficial to someone looking for help, if the dang thing were accurate.
 However, and this is an obvious however, there are several factors that work against the idea of using this on Stack Overflow.
 
 Anything that doesn't obviously state that it is generated by ChatGPT is in express violation of ChatGPT's own Sharing and Publication Policy. While this doesn't obviously fix the ""bad"" output that the AI can emit, given that the authors have this good-faith statement in it...it means that the lazy copy-and-paste really don't have much of a leg to stand on.
 
 â€œThe author generated this text in part with GPT-3, OpenAIâ€™s large-scale language-generation model. Upon generating draft language, the author reviewed, edited, and revised the language to their own liking and takes ultimate responsibility for the content of thisÂ publication.â€
 
 
 It combines the worst of the worst - good intentions with misleading information. I understand - extensively - with my years of experience on the network, that people just want to help. Problem is that ""help"" is difficult to measure at any given point in time, and the question that someone needs help with is rarely as straightforward as, ""do X"".
 Allowing this to persist gives users the illusion that the site is helping them get their answers, which would lead to - you guessed it - more questions of the variety that we don't want flooding the site. Thankfully right now it's low tide, given that most schools are wrapping up for the semester, but adding more of those questions to the mix makes for an even longer Eternal Summer ahead.

101087,,,"TL;DR: I propose limiting the ability to post answers in quick succession to address the problem because the problem is not individual answers generated by AI but users posting many auto-generated answers in a short period of time in order to farm reputation.
 
 The effort to create answers via AI that look correct at a first glance but are in many cases incorrect or incomplete is very low (just a few seconds).
 The effort for the person that asked the original question to read, understand and test out the answer to find out whether the answer actually answers the question is much higher (minutes).
 In the same way, the effort for other people reading the question and answers to the question to identify whether the answer is correct and valid is much higher (minutes).
 So, a person can generate a lot of answers using AI in a very short time while other persons need to invest a lot of time to verify the correctness of the answers in order to be able to up- or downvote them.
 
 I propose to address the issue by putting stricter limits on how many answers users are allowed to post in a short time.
 The current limits are:
 Answering
 
 Users with < 125 rep must wait 3 minutes between answers
 Users with between 125 and 10k rep trip CAPTCHA* if more than once per 60 seconds, or within 5 seconds of starting new post
 Users with â‰¥ 10k rep trip CAPTCHA* if more than once per 30 seconds, or within 5 seconds of starting new post
 Users of any reputation level can only answer the same question once every 60 seconds
 
 I propose to increase the time to wait before being allowed to post another answer to at least 1 hour for low-reputation users. Or limit the number of answers allowed to maybe 2 per day for low-reputation users. A new limit (waiting time between answers or max number of answers per day) should be introduced for users with medium reputation.

 Read the question, understand the question
 Maybe read and understand other answers already present
 Read documentation, reproduce issue locally
 Check for duplicates
 Try out solution locally
 Write down and explain solution

 Basically, you create some kind of system user that posts an AI-generated answer to ~every question.

You mark it as a bot. You surround the answer with the necessary warnings. Its answers are all community wiki, meaning the bot never gains any reputation and users are encouraged to edit the answer if it's only slightly wrong. The bot automatically deletes its own answers if they get a low enough score.

 Stack Overflow is a website for programmers and developers to ask and answer questions related to coding and computer programming. It is intended to be a resource for people who are looking for help with specific programming problems or who want to learn more about a particular topic. Because AI-generated answers may not always be accurate or relevant, they could potentially cause confusion or mislead users who are looking for help on Stack Overflow. In addition, AI-generated answers may not always follow the formatting and style guidelines of the site, which could make them difficult to read or understand. For these reasons, it may be appropriate for Stack Overflow to ban AI-generated answers.
 
 On the other hand, ""why should stack overflow allow ai generated answers?""
 
 There are a few potential benefits to allowing AI-generated answers on Stack Overflow. For one, AI-generated answers could potentially provide more accurate and detailed answers to users' questions. This could be especially useful for complex technical questions that may be difficult for human experts to answer. Additionally, AI-generated answers could help to reduce the workload for human experts, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.
 However, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider. For example, AI-generated answers may not always be accurate or helpful, and there may be concerns about the potential for bias in the algorithms used to generate answers. Additionally, some users may have concerns about the use of AI in general, and may prefer to receive answers from human experts.
 Overall, whether or not to allow AI-generated answers on Stack Overflow is a complex decision that would need to be carefully considered by the community.",2419,0,05-12-2022 6.18,Temp_policy_ans,0.099739583

Of all the sites on the network, Stack Overflow was hit by far the hardest. However, we are measuring its impact both on Stack Overflow and across the network -- and, the impact of ChatGPT is currently diminishing everywhere. Some sites will see more or less activity on a given day, but outside Stack Overflow, it appears to be leveling off to a very slow trickle. On Stack Overflow, its usage rate is still falling quickly.Because sites are impacted to such different degrees by the usage of ChatGPT, we encourage sites to create these policiesas they become an issue. A blanket policy does no good if affected communities are not simultaneously developing the methods they use to combat the material problems they face. Instead, it risks being actively unproductive, by setting an expectation that sites will purge this content without giving them targeted tools to do so.Our work internally progresses on identifying these posts and making our systems more resilient to issues like this in the future. We recognize that this is a shot across the bow, and the problem isn't going to go away in the long term. But for now, it seems we've weathered this storm mostly intact. As always, we'll reevaluate this decision in the future, if the circumstances warrant it.And, of course, if any site experiences a volume of GPT posts that are cumbersome to manage, or a site needs any other support managing an influx of unwanted content, we are always happy to help apply the tools we have at our disposal.",22,0,2023-03-13 18:27:13Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.054354839

63550,This_is_NOT_a_forum,,"Let me back this up and look at the broader picture here. We're about to enter a time that Star Trek once hinted at, but is now here and ready for your use:artificially generated content. The Internet has now reached maturity and search engines can run as much training data down your throat as you can handle. Quite literally we're watching the true next iteration of the Internet be born right now. Google can show you what already exists. AIs can generate almost anything your mind can dream up.The problem there is ownership. The US helped the Internet in its infancy bymaking an environment where you can ""Fair Use"" just about everything.[O]nline intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what others say and do.If you post a meme on SE that's using a copyrighted image, all SE has to do is take it down to avoid liability. With such a low bar to clear, it's allowed Fair Use to thrive. But... what do we do when these AIsstart generating content that is wholly based on the works of others?Allen's victory prompted lively discussions on Twitter, Reddit, and the Midjourney Discord server about the nature of art and what it means to be an artist. Some commenters think human artistry is doomed thanks to AI and that all artists are destined to be replaced by machines. Others think art will evolve and adapt with new technologies that come along, citing synthesizers in music. It's a hot debate that Wired covered in July.Andwill these tools drown out actual users?Established artist communities are at a tough crossroads because they fear non-AI artwork getting drowned out by an unlimited supply of AI-generated art, and yet the tools have also become notably popular among some of their members.These are from September, involving art communities, but all ChatGPT is doing is basically a fancier search than Google can serve up. And this problem isn't going to go away because we're using machine learningeverywhere. If an AI can't do it now, just wait.For my fellow mods and I on Stack Overflow, the root problem boils down to two issuesChatGPT is a parrotParrots are very smart birds and they can mimic sounds very well. Butparrots cannot talk. Theyemulate the sounds they hearbut they do not comprehend what they're saying.ChatGPT is better than any chatbot we've seen. It writes in natural language, not the stilted text that typifies such systems. It generates what appears at first blush to be quality content. But we've noted that ChatGPT is doing what a lot of inexperienced users on Stack Overflow do: try to be the best-sounding parrot. Someone asked ChatGPT if it should be allowed to answer Stack Overflow questions and posted it in a now-deleted answer on our rule. I do have to admit it's amusingI am writing to express my extreme disapproval of the idea of allowing ChatGPT answers on Stack Overflow. This would be an irresponsible move and would fundamentally undermine the integrity of the platform.Polly want a cracker? (fascinating English.SE etymology lesson there)ChatGPT is not a writer or programmer, it's just copying other smart-sounding sources that look highly relevant. It can (to its inventors' credit) write simple, passable code. But ChatGPT doesn't know whatSQL injection isand another mod experimenting with it found it will merrily give you code suggestions using it. Why? For too long that was how a lot of people did it on the Internet, and you can still find that poor advice everywhere. Hence why a lot of folks on Stack Overflow will incessantly warn you about not doing that.The various AI image generators can afford to be parrots. In fact, that's what the users want. ""Paint me a picture of a cat riding a unicorn carrying a shotgun in the style of Vincent Van Gogh"". That doesn't work so well when you need something like ""How do I create a contact form on my WordPress blog?"" That's not something I would trust ChatGPT to answer. It might give you workable code that someone will use to gain control of said blog.DishonestyI won't link the person who said this, but this is a real Twitter postSo I started a new stackoverflow account and I am plugging random questions without answers intohttps://chat.openai.com/chatand pasting the answer.
 So far, after 9 answers in 1.5 hours it has 1 accepted and 3 upvotes and a reputation of 62...And6 accepted answers, of the 26, 11 upvotes, 5 downvotes. I am not checking the answers in any way. I'll give it a rest for now and see how we do tomorrow...ðŸ˜„I'm sure ChatGPT (or Google if you wanna go old school) can tell you where to find this user, but that second statement is downright scary.They're not checking the answers in any way. In other wordsthey also are not a programmer. I've already gone over why that part is a problem, but there's another one here:This user admits they didn't write the code. From theMeta Stack Overflow FAQ on non-English contentTranslating a question for a non-English speaker sets them and all participants up for a poor experience, due to the OP not being able to follow and respond to feedback from comments, understand answers, or get assistance from the Help Center.The inverse of that is true here. A user comes in and asks a question. Someone posts an AI-generated answer without understanding anything about the question. What if the questioner posts a comment asking a clarifying question? What if the AI did something confusing in their answer? This user cannot interact in a meaningful way with said questioner. And, going back to the art site debacle,who owns it if it's been copied?I mean, we don't use Creative Commons for no reason. This butts up against plagiarism in a most uncomfortable way.TL;DR What do we do about it?Answers generated by an AIshould be considered as being written by the AI. That means you can quote them like any other source, butyou must attribute them to the AI, just like any other source, and not use a bulk-copied AI answer quote as an answer. This way, we're avoiding the thorny issues of people running to the latest AI to get answers so they can copy-paste them as their own. We have plagiarism tools (current and forthcoming) in this wheelhouse so we don't need to reinvent any wheels.If the AI gives a bad answer, we have votes for that.",71,0,2022-12-06 00:07:57Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.095466478

,,,"I believe any AI-generated content needs to be banned network-wide, because it is an attribution/plagiarism nightmare scenarioSome of the other answers have focused on the difficulties with moderating AI-generated content for correctness, accuracy, usefulness, etc., and I don't meaningfully disagree with those answers. But I do think there is a big, big problem,especially for a website network like Stack Exchange, which is the near-impossibility of properly attributing credit for the words that the AI is producing.The main problem is that the vast majority of AI-generating algorithms publicly available, including ChatGPT, do not properly credit the sources that were used in the training model that the AI used to tune its internal model. This means that any answers generated by the AI are, de facto,plagiarism.Many of these AI algorithms/organizations will obviate around the plagiarism issues in ways that avoid obvious legal culpability: ChatGPT, for example, refers to this data as""human AI trainers"". But it remains the case that any use of these algorithms will constitute plagiarism until/unless stringent rules are applied to these organizations that they A) directly attribute every text that was used to train the AI model, B) only obtained these texts from authors that gave explicit, documented consent to have their texts used in these models, and C) document these contributions and make that data publicly available.That doesn't necessarily mean it will never be appropriate to reference an AI-generated text per the normal Stack Exchange rules about quoting sources/using quote blocks in an answer (I have some skepticism abouthow oftenthat will be appropriate), but I do think that this meansâ€”pending major ethical overhauls in AI-generated contentâ€”it will never be appropriate for AI-generated text to manifest as the body of an answer posted on this network.EDIT:I don't know why this answer in particular is attracting users who seem ignorant about the relationship between Neural-Network AIs and actual biological human cognition, but to address a few recurring comments I've been seeing:No, Neural Net AI Algorithms are not capable of Original Thought in the same way that humans areAddendum: I amnotsaying that any/all AI Algorithms are not/will never be capable of original thought, but Neural Networks certainly are not.Neural Networksget their name from a conceptual similaritybetween how biological neurons function and the abstract model of ""Neurons"" deployed in Neural Networks, which unfortunately has led to false equivalencies being made between the two, implying that human neurons and AI neurons are essentially equivalent or ""the same, but varying in speed/power/etc."", and it needs to be understood that this is fundamentally untrue.There's a lot of technical reasons why the comparison isn't particularly cogent, but to reduce it down to the simplest form possible: the biggest reason that Neural Networks cannot produce original thought is because they're not trying to. Neural Networks are designed with 'emulation' of existing data as an end-goal. To use ChatGPT as an example, its goal is not to create original ideas, its goal is to produce text that its model detects, with high consensus, is similar to the text that a human* has already produced. Stable Diffusion and other AI-Art-Generating algorithms operate on similar principles, attempting not to produce original paintings, but instead to produce an image that is similar to images that humans have already created.* as defined by the model's training data, which I am assuming consists entirely of human-produced content but it should be acknowledged this may not be the case since the sloppiness with which sources are pulled into the model can in many cases pull in other AI-generated content, which would train the model not to talk like a human but instead talk like an AIA really good case study for this ""don't produce something original, produce something that resembles something that has already been created"" function of neural networks is a test I performed, using Stable Diffusion, where I described a hypothetical D&D character (""Githyanki Woman in Red Trenchcoat"") and had the algorithm try to generate an image.These were the produced results, which give us some important insights. The algorithm attempted to produce 4 images, and of those 4 images, two of them clearly modeled Cosplay photos (with some distressing facial distortion, which I'm guessing is the influence of the 'Githyanki' species modifier) and the other two generated... images of physical tabletop tokens, stand and everything.It's not difficult to figure out what happened. The metadata of 'Githyanki' (a rare but playable humanoid species in some editions of Dungeons and Dragons) connected the algorithm to images that were created in Heroforge and other TTRPG token creators, along with cosplay photos of people modelling Critical Role characters (or their own original D&D characters). This is how the algorithm tried to establish 'similarity' between the images it created and the images it associates with the prompt provided.But it's also very clear that none of the images produced are images that a human artist would create. In fact, the only way a human would produce any of those images themselves is if they had attempted to cheat the promptâ€”grabbing an image from a token generating website or a cosplay photoshoot and passing it off as their own work.In other words,the AI did an exemplary job of replicating what a human committing blatant plagiarism might attempt to produce.The reason I'm going into this long explanation and case study, aside from reinforcing my point about modern AI-generation algorithms only really being capable of committing mass-scale plagiarism, is to emphasize this point about these algorithms not being capable of original thought, and why arguments like ""it's just like a human brain!"" or ""humans don't have to cite their training, why should AI have to?"" are invalid. Some prompts are easier for the AI to replicate than others; certainly my example prompt broke the limits of what the AI was capable of replicating. But it's critical to understand that even when the AI is doing a much better job of reproducing what the prompt has asked it to generate, it's still doing the exact same thing as when it broke under the weight of my request: copying the data it found in its training data.Now, the ethics of these algorithms can be solved: these algorithms could purge their databases, begin taking data only from artists who have explicitly consented to have their art/writing ingested, properly cite each work ingested, and make that data publicly available and easy to access, solving the widespread plagiarism I started out by addressing. I would even go a step further and argue that to be truly ethical the algorithm would also have to be able to cite the specific works whose influences composed the specific resulting output, but I'm guessing that might be technologically infeasible.Important: something being ""technologically infeasible"" is not the same thing as saying ""so we don't/shouldn't have to care about it"". If AI-Art or AI-Writing can't be done ethically, I would argue it shouldn't be done at all, and whether or not running these algorithms ethically is a thing that can be done isn't in my purview.But we need to dispose of this notion that these algorithms are, in any meaningful sense, engaging in original thought. They're not, and they're not truly replicating human thought, either at the macro level of human consciousness or at the micro level of individual brain neurons. Neural Networks are designed to emulate and reproduce existing works based on what the algorithm detects as being similar to those existing works, and they can be in some cases very uncanny replications, but they aren't original creations.",44,0,2022-12-15 15:42:32Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.119879197

Also, there are other tools that can correct language errors.Because users that have the expertise, don't need AI, if we allow such answers to be posted, there would be extremely small amount of such answers, as verifying the AI generated content would probably take more time than writing the answer.We are not going to lose any good content posted and verified by the experts in such cases.AI becomes so good it gives correct answersThis will probably never become true, but let's pretend that AI will generate if not always, then correct answers most of the time.If this would be true, then people could just directly ask AI the question, instead of posting it on Stack Exchange. Similarly, currently people are supposed to read the documentation and use Google or other search engines for solutions before simply asking questions.We don't need to allow AI generated answers, if AI can directly solve the problem.Another aspect why we need to permanently ban AI, is that AI didn't magically appear. It is being trained on human generated content. Stack Exchange strives for quality, and we need to preserve human generated content to do that. If we allow AI answers, no matter how good they are, we will start losing experts willing to share their knowledge.If you can post in a few seconds what AI gave you, why would you bother adding original content? With time, less and less people will be motivated to participate, and in the end, Stack Exchange will become a collection of AI generated posts nobody will read anyway because it would be much faster to ask AI directly.And when you can effortlessly get virtual Internet points, they will lose value fast.",30,0,2022-12-06 14:13:16Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.141304348

I've found ChatGPT to be a good tool (when it's up) for quickly suggesting better grammar in several posts thatneededimprovements.Example 1:Beforeandafter. IIRC, I'm fairly certain I did change one word from the ChatGPT suggestion -- I felt ""the issue persists"" was better than ""this issue persists"".Example 2:Beforeandafter: I definitely made some small tweaks to the ChatGPT suggestion to make it slightly more concise, but I can't recall exactly what they were.I do a lot of grammar/clarity edits (including, frequently, on my own mistakes). While I certainlycouldhave cleaned up these two posts on my own, ChatGPT saved alotof effort in these cases, and I believe the posts (and site) are better for it. In no way did ChatGPT suggest an answer here, or rely on any training other than proper English grammar.Should this use be banned as well?Counterpoint: ChatGPT can still make grammar mistakes that change the meaning of the post. If the editor doesn't carefully review the changes to assure consistent meaning, then there's a risk of a bad (and disallowed) edit.Counterpoint-to-counterpoint: And yet, honest mistakes in editing happen even with human intervention (perhapseven more so).I'm not saying I have the answer here, just raising the question of whether (or not) there are acceptable and positive uses of ChatGPT.Position: Attribution issues are a nightmare, since ChatGPT can't tell us where it learned something.I struggle with this one as well.

Why would we expect an AI to be able to cite/attribute its source for where it learned something when most of us don't know ourselves?The problem, of course, is when there is only asingle-sourceof the information.

I'll try to search the web to find it again so that I can attribute it, but most people wouldn't even go that far.

However, if an SE user tends to post incorrect answers, then they should be banned.Example of attribution that we could require users to add:This answer was (partly) written byChatGPT, but I have the expertise to confirm it is correct.Notes:Themost upvoted answeris pretty much the same as this answer.SO banned ChatGPT on the basis that it can generate a wrong answer, and Puzzling SEbannedChatGPT on the basis that it can generate acorrectanswer.Follow-ups:How often does ChatGPT give an incorrect answer to an SE question?How can we identify ChatGPT-generated posts?How good should a generative question-answering system or a language model be to be allowed to write answers on Stack Exchange?Which online software to use to check answers on StackExchange for plagiarism?How can a language model keep track of the provenance of the main knowledge/sources used to generate a given output?",-50,0,2022-12-26 03:36:57Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.011666667

The problem with people using ChatGPT etc is that potentiallyneitherof them actually understands the answer.

400209,IÃ±aki Viggers,57,"I agree for the most part. SE's stated ""overall"" reason for banning ChatGPT is its low rate of correct answers. Thus, wherever ChatGPT tends to give correct answers the ban has no reason of being.This other answermakes a good point in regard to attribution, and that sole issue does not really warrant a ban.",0,0,2023-02-28 16:01:18Z,Ban_ChatGPT,0.139285714

280924,Peter Cordes,309,"I like this in theory, but in practice I worry it would be too much of a slippery slope with people claiming they understood what ChatGPT was saying, but didn't fully check it. That's nearly indistinguishable from making a valid effort but missing a bug, resulting in an SO post that's still actively unhelpful, wasting reader's time with a false lead. (Or worse, not having the expertise to know about something like SQL injection being a problem with a proposed solution.) I don't see a good way to set up a penalty structure for when bad answers are eventually uncovered.",0,0,2023-06-19 15:37:40Z,Ban_ChatGPT,-0.104166667
