"Afterwards I asked it something like ""What letter does Snake begin with?"" and it responded ""S"" and then I said ""But you said it started with C. Was that a mistake?"" and then it just had a psychological break and wouldn't stop apologising for being unreliable.  

I think because it is a natural language AI, if you can trick it into saying something incorrect with a sufficiently complex prompt, then ask it to explain its reasoning, it will start saying all kinds of nonsense as its purpose is just for its English to look natural in the context of someone explaining something.

&lt;p&gt;I think because it is a natural language AI, if you can trick it into saying something incorrect with a sufficiently complex prompt, then ask it to explain its reasoning, it will start saying all kinds of nonsense as its purpose is just for its English to look natural in the context of someone explaining something.

"It's understandable that some people might not want to use tools like Github Copilot or ChatGPT for code generation. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to writing code, and some people may prefer to do it manually instead of using a tool.

Additionally, tools like this can help to reduce the possibility of errors or bugs in the code. By using a tool that can generate code based on a set of instructions or specifications, developers can ensure that the code they write is accurate and consistent.

"I asked it what some of the downsides to using it for the purpose of answering Stack Overflow questions might be:

&gt;There are several potential pitfalls to using me, or any large language model trained by OpenAI, to answer Stack Overflow questions. Some of the main ones are:

&gt;I am not able to browse the internet, so I cannot provide answers to questions that require me to look up information online.

&gt;My training is based on a large corpus of text, but I do not have any specific knowledge or expertise in any particular domain. This means that my answers may not always be accurate or relevant to the question being asked.

&gt;I am not able to learn from my interactions with users, so my answers may not improve over time. This means that if a user asks a question that I am not able to answer accurately, I will not be able to provide a better answer in the future.

&gt;I am not able to understand the specific context or intentions of the user who is asking the question. This means that my answers may not always be appropriate or helpful.

&gt;Overall, while I can provide general information and assistance on a wide range of topics, I am not well-suited to answering specific questions on Stack Overflow, or other online forums that require domain-specific knowledge and expertise.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several potential pitfalls to using me, or any large language model trained by OpenAI, to answer Stack Overflow questions. Some of the main ones are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not able to browse the internet, so I cannot provide answers to questions that require me to look up information online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My training is based on a large corpus of text, but I do not have any specific knowledge or expertise in any particular domain. This means that my answers may not always be accurate or relevant to the question being asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not able to learn from my interactions with users, so my answers may not improve over time. This means that if a user asks a question that I am not able to answer accurately, I will not be able to provide a better answer in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not able to understand the specific context or intentions of the user who is asking the question. This means that my answers may not always be appropriate or helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while I can provide general information and assistance on a wide range of topics, I am not well-suited to answering specific questions on Stack Overflow, or other online forums that require domain-specific knowledge and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

"&gt; I've been testing it as a programming tool and oh boy is it good.

Not really. I believe that realistically people are lending a much higher level of AI to ChatGPT than it really has. Is it astonishing? Sure. Is it the future of absolutely everything like it claims? No.

I've been testing it for about a week now and I've asked it numerous questions related to programming ranging from very easy, to very difficult. It's had a great deal of trouble with a wide range of things.

ChatGPT won't be replacing anything like SO for a long time. You simply can't beat experience when it comes to things like this. In addition to that, the AI is optimized for simulated communication and is not specifically designed for these types of tasks. Even tangential tasks it fails at. For example, I asked it to write a 1000 word essay on WPA3.

It did very well. It was able to write a coherent and intelligent essay that explored the different facets of WPA3 vs WPA2 and why it's better as well as some of the better features of WPA3. However, it completely failed to do what I asked it to do. In the end it generated 543 words, not 1000, and when checked for plagiarism, it was 43% similar to a number of documents (classified as ""significant plagiarism"") it likely pulled information directly from. It was 25% similar to a single source which likely means a significant amount of the information was pulled directly from [this page](https://www.netspotapp.com/blog/wifi-security/wifi-encryption-and-security.html). That raises legal issues as well as ethical ones. The same will be true for any code it produces.

"&gt;I think people are forgetting that this is an AI and it is not in and of itself creative. It's not producing information. It regurgitating it from other sources...

This point is incorrect, in my opinion. This same idea is purpotrated all the time for image gen AIs, and it always stems from a lack of understanding of how the AI functions. AIs do not cut and paste from other sources. AIs do not algorithmically decide to take a bunch of existing things and combine them into a new one. No. AIs *learn* to make new things in the *exact same way* humans learn to make new things: By repetition and slowly getting better at it.

An AI is fed some text, images, etc, and told to make something similar starting with random noise. At the beginning, it simply produces more random noise, but eventually it learns to produce something similar to what was fed into it. Thus, anything that appears in the original inputs enough times, could slowly appear in some way in the output, because the AI has learned that it should always include that (because it appeared a lot). This is why fake artist signatures sometimes appear in images generation AI outputs, for example. The AI has not copied the signatures, but rather, it has learned to add a signature to the art.

Its very important to note that this learning process is no different than how any human learns to write, make art, or make anything else: Both AIs and humans learn to make new things based off of existing things. The question is, can an AI be creative and make something new, like humans can?

So now is the argument of whether an AI can be ""creative"" or not. And this really comes down to individual definition and interpretation. For me, ""creativity"" means being able to develop something new thats different from existing things. And this is a personal opinion, but I believe AIs can do this, and heres why:

AI neural network weights are initially randomized completely according to some probability distribution. And even after millions of training cycles, some of those weights always remain more or less random and unchanged, despite the training inputs and then weight adjustments. And yet, *every single* weight contrubutes something or other, no matter how small, to the final output. So what Im saying is, this inherent randomness with the AI itself leads it to have some kind of ""creativity"", because it has the capability to do things that *were not* specified by the training.

So now for my final note. AIs are not an algorithm that cuts and pastes to form something ""new"". No. AIs learn and generate new things in the same way humans do, and Imo have the capability to be creative, just like humans are. So can an AI plagerize? Of course. But is everything an AI makes plagerism? No. Just like anything a human makes, its up to the individual case in question.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-10T12:41:56.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its very important to note that this learning process is no different than how any human learns to write, make art, or make anything else: Both AIs and humans learn to make new things based off of existing things. The question is, can an AI be creative and make something new, like humans can?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now is the argument of whether an AI can be &amp;quot;creative&amp;quot; or not. And this really comes down to individual definition and interpretation. For me, &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot; means being able to develop something new thats different from existing things. And this is a personal opinion, but I believe AIs can do this, and heres why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI neural network weights are initially randomized completely according to some probability distribution. And even after millions of training cycles, some of those weights always remain more or less random and unchanged, despite the training inputs and then weight adjustments. And yet, &lt;em&gt;every single&lt;/em&gt; weight contrubutes something or other, no matter how small, to the final output. So what Im saying is, this inherent randomness with the AI itself leads it to have some kind of &amp;quot;creativity&amp;quot;, because it has the capability to do things that &lt;em&gt;were not&lt;/em&gt; specified by the training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now for my final note. AIs are not an algorithm that cuts and pastes to form something &amp;quot;new&amp;quot;. No. AIs learn and generate new things in the same way humans do, and Imo have the capability to be creative, just like humans are. So can an AI plagerize? Of course. But is everything an AI makes plagerism? No. Just like anything a human makes, its up to the individual case in question.&lt;/p&gt;

"""They"" being me, but you're right. Also the Kermit-ness was not readily apparent in the Kermit rap.

It tends to shy away from being snarky, rude, or snide unless you really tease it out or hit a lucky instance that has more relaxed instructions for subduing snark.

It's easier to get snark out of it if you give it a character that's naturally very snarky. For example:

That's my point. Sentients is a requirement for creativity. You're anthropomorphizing AI.

This AI isn't _creating_ anything. It's hobbling together available resources coherently. That's not the same as creativity.

Most of SO is beginner level questions. ChatGPT is more than capable answering those how to make for-loop questions. It would be silly to not consider this use case valuable.

The ML pattern recognition does use sources like SO but not by directly quoting results similar to Google. It adapts multiple sources and comes out with conclusions (pattern recognition). It's actually pretty similar how we answer in SO too. It's not like we were born with the information. We heard/read the solution somewhere else most of the time.

"Well and Stackoverflow karma farming has a bit of a problem on SO. It involves speed, getting an answer, getting a lot of upvotes from people browsing, _maybe_ getting it accepted as the answer, kinda in that order. But this is a very low percentage game.

Now normally it takes a fairly long time (anywhere from 5-30 minutes) to answer a SO question, which puts a cap on the amount of shots you can take, and thus the amount of karma you can farm.

But ChatGPT answers mean one could spam answers that seem correct (even if they introduce other problems or aren’t quite right) very quickly. Copy/paste 30 seconds move on to the next. You’re probably not really helping people, you’re spamming SO’s systems and you’re introduced an arms race: the only way to hit 100,000 rep on SO (or whatever number will look good on a resume) is to use an AI.

"I had a side project a while back that was basically alerts for anything. Like you could just type ""alert me when the new game of thrones book is released"", and it would just poll the Internet periodically and send you a text when it happened.

The problem I eventually came across is it might be impossible to programmatically tell if an arbitrary statement is true or false. It requires trusted sources, which you don't have enough of. Kinda gave up on the idea after that.

OpenGPT might have the same issue. It's just writing something that reads like someone who is correct would write.

"It used to bug me too, then I realized the majority of people posting and talking constantly about it in subs are most likely students or jr devs. For 97% of the problems I deal with on a daily basis, asking chatGPT would be a waste of time compared to just solving it myself - it knows nothing about our stack, how our software was written, so it has no context to help with non-trivial issues, and the amount of time I would spend trying to explain things to it would be ten folds more than the time it would take me to just figure it out with my own goddamn brain. 

Think about it - students or people maintaining simple CRUD apps (no hate at all, we all started somewhere!) are _much_ more likely to spend time playing around with and talking about a tool that can do the same things they do daily; people who have to spend their time solving very complex problems 1. don’t have a ton of time to spend hours playing around with this 2. don’t care to spend a ton of time talking about it, as, while it may be cool, it’s not helping or impacting their work on a daily basis.

"You have to ask the right questions.

Here is an example( not coding )

From ChatGPT

me: is it likely that google also has an ai as advanced as you are?

CGPT: It is likely that Google has an AI as advanced as I am, or even more advanced. Google is a leader in the field of artificial intelligence and has invested heavily in research and development in this area.

Google has developed a number of AI technologies, including machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies have been applied to a wide range of applications, including search, advertising, and image and video analysis.

In addition, Google has developed its own AI platform, called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers to build and train machine learning models. TensorFlow is capable of handling large amounts of data and can be used to train advanced AI models.

Overall, it is likely that Google has AI technologies and platforms that are as advanced, or even more advanced, than I am. Google is a leader in the field of AI and has made significant investments in research and development in this area.

edit:

me: why wouldn't google release it for everyone like openai?

CGPT:

It is unlikely that Google would release its advanced AI technologies for everyone like OpenAI. OpenAI is a non-profit organization that is focused on advancing the field of AI for the benefit of all humanity. As a result, OpenAI often releases its AI technologies and research publicly for anyone to use and build upon.

In contrast, Google is a for-profit company that is focused on creating technologies and products that generate revenue and profits for the company. As a result, Google is more likely to keep its advanced AI technologies proprietary and use them to develop products and services that can be sold to customers.

Additionally, Google may have concerns about releasing its advanced AI technologies publicly, as this could lead to competition from other companies that could use the technologies to develop similar products and services. This could potentially harm Google's business and reduce its market share.

Overall, while Google may have advanced AI technologies that are similar to those developed by OpenAI, it is unlikely that Google would release them publicly like OpenAI. Google is focused on creating products and services that generate revenue and profits, and may have concerns about competition and potential harm to its business.

"Right, the Turing test is kind of broken now because people often behave in a way that might not ""pass"" it.

ChatGTP is certainly impressive. But for one thing, it tells you exactly what it is, which breaks the Turing test off the bat. It's either telling you it isn't human or it is a human insisting that it isn't human. And I don't mean, *duh, it always has that caveat but if you removed it then it might pass.* It also does it if it can't produce an output to explain why it can't produce the output.

But even beyond that, while its responses are impressive in terms of natural language and maybe even some cognition, a lot of it sounds like a human reading from a script.

Like, if you start it up for the first time and ask you to write a story about something it will do that and it seems pretty amazing. And you can even tell it to modify the story. But after 1 or 2 exchanges, it gets rather repetitive. I don't think at any point you are going to have a reason to believe that you are either 1) talking to a computer or 2) talking to a human who is reading a script/deliberately ""acting"" like a computer.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-12T15:00:51.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, the Turing test is kind of broken now because people often behave in a way that might not &amp;quot;pass&amp;quot; it.&lt;/p&gt;

The trouble really comes from the fact that the whole current pipeline is built for big data. Very few people are even looking at small data, which is a fundamental requirement for animal-like intelligence. A cat can tell from one experience that a hot stove is something dangerous. 

Another more serious problem is that current NN architectures are not at all related to how the brain works. GPT3 is most likely a dead-end architecturally speaking.

There are other hurdles as well, including the biggest one, and that is simply the fact that a tiny minority in the field is actually working on trying to recreate human-like intelligence.

The process of tuning was described as long and difficult. Which maybe it was thinking more as a beginner? Idk. I've done it enough that I get it in the ballpark by feel.

"Yeah the thing some people are missing. The fact that this is a conversational model lets it respond to mistakes it's made by fixing them.

Doesn't always work, but it works far far more often than you'd think. You can even feed compiler errors etc into it and it does a decent at puzzling out and fixing them.

EDIT: For anything super complex though, you'd still have the be a competent programmer to either fix it yourself or know how to articulate what's wrong and tell the AI what it might be able to do to fix it. Sometimes that's a bit of prompt engineering but it might save you some time. I particularly like how it comes up with plausible ways to string libraries together into a minimal example and you can interrogate it about how to do other things with that setup or what it might look like if you swap out components with something else, or how you might wrap it into docker etc. If you really don't know where to start on putting together a project and only know the general parts you want to use and what your end goal is, it's pretty great.

It's hard to get it to do much more than that right now well (iirc its memory is only 4000 tokens anyways), but it's shockingly good at solving smaller problems, compilation issues, glue code, etc given the right context. Just don't expect it to keep working correctly after you've done too much in a single chat history. Gotta clear the history occasionally and provide the specifics you need to get useful stuff out of it.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-12T06:35:30.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah the thing some people are missing.

It tends to shy away from being snarky, rude, or snide unless you really tease it out or hit a lucky instance that has more relaxed instructions for subduing snark.

It's easier to get snark out of it if you give it a character that's naturally very snarky. For example:

"The real telltale sign is that for anything not previously seen in the model, it comes up with extremely confident sounding answers that don't pass the smell test if you actually know anything about the subject matter. It has weirdly specific gaps in knowledge and makes very odd recommendations. It'll do things like telling people the right configuration, but then tells them to stuff it in the wrong configuration file where you'll get an obvious parse error or whatever. Sometimes the suggested config will leave obvious artifacts of some specific project it ripped it from.

Judging this is going to be hard. People have brainfarts like that too. But if there's a pattern of really specific brainfarts, it's probably someone sneaking in ChatGPT answers.

Sometimes the suggested config will leave obvious artifacts of some specific project it ripped it from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging this is going to be hard. People have brainfarts like that too. But if there&amp;#39;s a pattern of really specific brainfarts, it&amp;#39;s probably someone sneaking in ChatGPT answers. And because of SO&amp;#39;s policy of deleting duplicates and over-eager mods that delete most of the posted content within 5 seconds, I imagine that ChatGPT will have a pretty high failure rate for anything that survives moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

It *really was* normal coffee temperature. It was served with a secure lid and in a cup with a warning label. The customer opened it herself, tried to hold it between her knees in the car, and spilled it all the fuck over herself.

Coffee is a dangerously hot product. McDonald's and every restaurant still makes it the same way. They didn't change anything but make the warning label slightly more prominent.
