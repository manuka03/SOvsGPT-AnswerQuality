"&gt; It is not appropriate to use a language model like ChatGPT to generate answers on Stack Overflow

Yawn.  I keep reading things like this that simply reek of people grasping at the hope that human experts won't be overtaken.  I'm sorry to say but that's in the process of happening right now.

What's the problem exactly if the answers are just as good, if not better?

My limited experience so far with ChatGPT - I've had a few problems in my day job that I'd normally go to Stack overflow with.  I tried describing the issue with included code samples, and ChatGPT has absolutely nailed it every time.

Cue some other software devs who do ""complex work"" saying that GPT-3 doesn't have domain knowledge.  (It does).","programming","r/programming","2022-12-06T13:06:20.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not appropriate to use a language model like ChatGPT to generate answers on Stack Overflow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yawn.  I keep reading things like this that simply reek of people grasping at the hope that human experts won&amp;#39;t be overtaken.  I&amp;#39;m sorry to say but that&amp;#39;s in the process of happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;

"I think it just depends on the prompt.  I asked it to explain cellular respiration (biology) through the medium of rap, and it gave me this:-

Verse 1:
We're in the cell, it's time to make some energy
We need to power up, that's our priority
We start with glucose, a simple sugar molecule
We break it down in stages, that's the cellular rule

Chorus:
It's cellular respiration, oh so sweet
We convert glucose into ATP
It's how we get our energy, that's right
From the food we eat, day and night

Verse 2:
First we start with glycolysis, that's where the action begins
We break down glucose, and we make some pyruvate
Then we enter the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs
We break down more molecules, and we make some ATP

Chorus:
It's cellular respiration, oh so sweet
We convert glucose into ATP
It's how we get our energy, that's right
From the food we eat, day and night

Verse 3:
Now we're in the last stage, the electron transport chain
We use oxygen to help us, and we make lots of ATP
We also produce water, that's a byproduct of the game
And that's how cellular respiration, fuels our cells to sustain

Chorus:
It's cellular respiration, oh so sweet
We convert glucose into ATP
It's how we get our energy, that's right
From the food we eat, day and night

I hope this rap helps you understand the process of cellular respiration in a fun and engaging way.

"sometimes you know how to do it but it's 50 lines of boiler-plate with very specific imports that might not be on top of your mind.

So it'll generate all code with all imports, not that you didn't know how to do it, you would have spent longer just finding correct imports &amp; dependencies.

Once you master the tool (ai generation of code) you'll know how to formulate and correct the ai with the best prompts to write entire classes in only couple of minutes without perfect libraries and/or dependencies knowledge.

A typical good programmer today isn't one that write his code in ASM, it's considered too low level so it's more of a niche kind of thing. Higher level languages can achieve the same result with less development time. (Consider how expensive are developpers, 1 saved day for a single developper is usually 800-1200$ saved for the company).

Incoming developers are going to be able to churn large codebases in highly reduced time, libraries are going to become more and more complete as they'll also be AI generated.

We'll still code but higher level stuffs than what is done today.

"This is the problem with AI generating the code. You have no idea if what it produced is correct and/or safe. Someone will have to go through it and make sure it will actually do what it is suppose to do, and not do what it is suppose to not do. As we all know, reading code is a hell of a lot harder to write, so it would probably end up taking MORE time using an AI to generate code than a human because the reviewer has no one to ask 'Why are things the way they are?' and get a real answer. 

It's like a clueless newb copying and pasting code from any and all sources because it kind of looks correct in the situation, but it doesn't know because it doesn't understand the situation, nor does it understand the solution.

Addendum (stream of conscious rant?):

Another weakness is the way in which the AI learns. At this point, it can't know what good code is. It, assumedly, learned off examples. It doesn't understand what the driving forces are for good code and for bad code. It is hypothetically possible to poison the well. 

Plus, if the AI starts to ingest it's own output for on going training, hypothetically possible because, at least as far as I know, it doesn't know what it did and did not write. Then, it is hypothetically possible for it to basically come to the conclusion that the only good code is the code it writes (ironic...) because the majority of the code out there was written by it. Sure, it might get checked like I mentioned above in the original portion of my comment, but I see it being distinctly possible that in order to save money, those reviews won't happen until they HAVE to, which will probably be in the event of a giant security breach or a company going bankrupt because the system crashed and no one knows how to get it running again because no one actually understands how anything actually works because no one built it.

"GimmickNG was always nosy and always poking his nose into everyone else's business. He'd ask questions that he shouldn't and he'd always want to know what was going on with everyone around him. But one day, GimmickNG's nosiness got him into trouble.

He was walking home from school when he saw his neighbor, Mr. Jones, walking down the street with a big box. GimmickNG couldn't help but ask what was inside the box, even though he knew he shouldn't. Mr. Jones didn't want to tell him, but GimmickNG wouldn't let it go.

""Come on, Mr. Jones,"" GimmickNG said. ""What's in the box?""

Mr. Jones sighed and said, ""It's none of your business, GimmickNG. Now go home and leave me alone.""

But GimmickNG wouldn't listen. He followed Mr. Jones all the way home and even peeked through the window to try and see what was inside the box. Finally, Mr. Jones had enough and he called the police.

When the police arrived, they asked GimmickNG why he was being so nosy and he couldn't give them a good answer. The police told him that it was rude and disrespectful to ask about other people's private business and that he should be more considerate of others' feelings.

GimmickNG felt ashamed and embarrassed. He realized that his nosiness had gotten him into trouble and that he needed to be more respectful of others' privacy. From then on, GimmickNG made sure to mind his own business and not ask any nosy questions.

"I'd argue the ship has sailed on ever trusting anything written on the internet to be human in origin, at least for English language content. There are simply no ways to fingerprint or watermark text content that 1) doesn't make the reader feel that it is obviously non-human in origin and 2) isn't absolutely trivial to mangle and make useless with a simple script.

Many bot farms present on social media (particularly the largest and most successful of those found here on reddit) have been abstracting away the task of generating text content for years; they've typically done this by either recycling text content that has been posted before, posting text content that originated from another website (imgur and YouTube comments have been rather popular sources), or using Markov chains to create plausible-looking text content. Just within the last year and change have these bots been opting to use machine learning-based text generators like GPT and it's counterparts.

The most reliable means of catching these bots would be to analyze their behavior instead of their content, but that becomes incredibly difficult and precipitates its own need for machine learning solutions, leading to another cat-and-mouse game in which bad actors will come out on top. 

I can't even begin to fathom how gargantuan of a problem this is for search engines. Google had just recently publicly acknowledged how their search results had been so infested with listicles and search parameter optimized pages that they had to completely rework PageRank, as it had been gamed completely and was functionally useless.

I fear that OpenAI may have created their own [cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive) in which online platforms may seek to run text content through public AI providers to determine if it was generated by AI or not. I know that some stable diffusion implementations use invisible watermarking techniques that persist within the image itself even if it's been tampered with, but the fidelity of information available in text is so fine that I don't believe you can reasonably encode and kind of information in it that wouldn't be trivial to mangle beyond use - this would leave the option of text generation services like ChatGPT needing to keep a database of mathematically analyzed snippets produced by each user that other snippets could then be run against. Even that may be infeasible, and most services certainly won't look kindly on paying a third party for a solution to a problem caused by that third party.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-05T18:43:40.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d argue the ship has sailed on ever trusting anything written on the internet to be human in origin, at least for English language content. There are simply no ways to fingerprint or watermark text content that 1) doesn&amp;#39;t make the reader feel that it is obviously non-human in origin and 2) isn&amp;#39;t absolutely trivial to mangle and make useless with a simple script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many bot farms present on social media (particularly the largest and most successful of those found here on reddit) have been abstracting away the task of generating text content for years; they&amp;#39;ve typically done this by either recycling text content that has been posted before, posting text content that originated from another website (imgur and YouTube comments have been rather popular sources), or using Markov chains to create plausible-looking text content. Just within the last year and change have these bots been opting to use machine learning-based text generators like GPT and it&amp;#39;s counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most reliable means of catching these bots would be to analyze their behavior instead of their content, but that becomes incredibly difficult and precipitates its own need for machine learning solutions, leading to another cat-and-mouse game in which bad actors will come out on top. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even begin to fathom how gargantuan of a problem this is for search engines. Google had just recently publicly acknowledged how their search results had been so infested with listicles and search parameter optimized pages that they had to completely rework PageRank, as it had been gamed completely and was functionally useless.&lt;/p&gt;

"ChatGPT is extremely impressive; but I stopped trusting it for technical accuracy when I discovered that it cannot handle ratios with fractions in them.
For example, if you tell it to simplify 3 : 2/3,   it will fail. You can explain to it where it went wrong, and maybe it you are persistent it will get it right... but if you give it another one, it will fail again.

For programming, and problem solving, there are a lot of times where the AI gets it right.

But for any tricky problem that I don't already know the answer to, I couldn't trust the AI's response; and I'd rather write it myself than debug its overly confident solution.

"I wanted to chime in on the recent ban on AI-generated answers. While I understand why you made the decision, I think it's a mistake to exclude AI-generated answers altogether. In some cases, AI models can provide valuable insights and solutions to complex technical questions that might be difficult for humans to answer.

Additionally, in situations where there is a lack of human expertise on a particular topic, AI-generated answers can serve as a useful resource for users looking for information. Instead of treating AI-generated answers as the final word on a subject, we can use them as a starting point for further discussion and clarification.

Of course, it's important to carefully evaluate and verify any AI-generated responses before relying on them. But overall, I think the benefits of AI-generated answers outweigh the potential drawbacks, and I hope you'll reconsider the ban on AI answers on Stack Overflow.

Thanks for listening!

While I understand why you made the decision, I think it&amp;#39;s a mistake to exclude AI-generated answers altogether. In some cases, AI models can provide valuable insights and solutions to complex technical questions that might be difficult for humans to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

"Yesterday I played around with it for more than an hour on mostly coding related thing. For some stuff it really works quite well and one question *can* vastly outperform a 10 minute Google (re)search session. But other times it's just wrong, it makes up options that are just not there. Also asking about more Mathematical things, it either refuses to answer or only simple things work (while getting the details inconsistent)

Anyway, since I read about these crazy coding examples, I thought I try it with that. Also since I have a pletora of half-finished/not even started projects, I thought I see if ChatGPT can get one off the ground. It was using SQLite3 data as Prolog facts (disclaimer: I only know Prolog superficially) The code it produces was convincing, well-commented and all. But after installing SWI Prolog again the sqlite library wouldn't work, even asked to swap it out but that didn't work either.

At this point sometimes it's better than Google.

"I understand your concern about the potential negative effects of AI, but I believe that the benefits of using AI far outweigh the drawbacks. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare and transportation to education and finance. It can help us solve complex problems and make our lives easier in countless ways.

Furthermore, I think it's important to remember that AI is simply a tool. It's up to us as humans to determine how it's used and to ensure that it's used responsibly. We can't let the potential drawbacks of AI prevent us from realizing its full potential and all the good it can do for society.

The benefits are mostly theoretical, and the harms are quite real as many have discovered how the AI can be wrong in extremely subtle and hard to detect ways, even for experienced programmers.

To paraphrase them, these language models are designed to output answers that look convincing, not answers that are correct.

You don't know what it does under the hood. To predict next token, it's helpful to have some models of the world, obviously. It's absurd to say it does _no_ problem solving. Obviously it's not perfect. If it were, it'd be way bigger deal. But it is impressive. Progress is _fast_.

&gt; But of course, if we ever succeed in AI, or in reductionism in general, **it must be by reducing Y to ‘just X’.

&gt; It has no qualia, no intentionality, no true self-awareness, no grounding in a rich multimodal real-world process of cognitive development yielding detailed representations and powerful causal models of reality; it cannot ‘want’ anything beyond maximizing a mechanical reward score, which does not come close to capturing the rich flexibility of human desires, or historical Eurocentric contingency of such conceptualizations, which are, at root, problematically Cartesian.

"&gt;  So then why are people salivating on any contribution to AI reasearch?

I prefer a shot at us getting this right over eternal stagnation. Not that it's possible anyway; even disregarding the problem of China being free to pursue it by itself.

Not about AI directly (and from 2017), but a nice text: [Today's Techno-Panic Would Have Killed the Printing Press](https://fee.org/articles/todays-techno-panic-would-have-killed-the-printing-press/). The conversation below is real:

(this first part is from a linked [source](http://faculty.webster.edu/corbetre/personal/reading/morrison-gutenberg.html)

&gt; Gutenberg: ‘After the Donatus, we shall make prayer books, missals, Psalters.’

&gt; Head monk: ‘This is work already done by scribes.’

&gt; Gutenberg: ‘A press could do it more quickly.’

&gt; Head monk: ‘But not with such beauty. When a monk writes, the hand of God writes for him.’

&gt; Gutenberg: ‘And yet errors creep in.’
&gt; 
&gt; Head monk: ‘Errors are easily made and simply corrected. Since only priests see them, no harm is done. Or do you intend the word of God to be read by anyone who pleases?’
&gt; 
&gt; It was not a question but a reproach. I stared at him a moment while gathering myself. Those eyes stream with Christ’s blood, I thought. That hair refuses to grow because the God he serves instructed it not to.

Copyists &lt;=&gt; artists, programmers etc.

And then there's this:

&gt; Gutenberg: ‘To help men and women be literate, to give them knowledge, to make books so cheap even a peasant might afford them: that is my hope, yes.’

&gt; Head monk: ‘The word of God needs to be interpreted by priests, not spread about like dung.’
&gt; 
&gt; Gutenberg: ‘I do not wish to despoil the Word.’
&gt; 
&gt; Head monk: ‘But it will happen. To hand it about to all and sundry is languorous, Would you have ploughmen and weavers debating the Gospel in taverns?’
&gt; 
&gt; Gutenberg: ‘If that is what they want to do.’
&gt; 
&gt; Head monk: ‘But what of the dangers? It would be like giving a candle to infants.’
&gt; 
&gt; Gutenberg: ‘Such copies we make of the Bible would first be for monasteries and churches.’
&gt; 
&gt; Head monk: ‘The Bible? You plan to make the Bible as well?’
&gt; 
&gt; Gutenberg: ‘I have considered it.’

&lt;p&gt;Head monk: ‘Errors are easily made and simply corrected. Since only priests see them, no harm is done. Or do you intend the word of God to be read by anyone who pleases?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not a question but a reproach. I stared at him a moment while gathering myself. Those eyes stream with Christ’s blood, I thought. That hair refuses to grow because the God he serves instructed it not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyists &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; artists, programmers etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg: ‘To help men and women be literate, to give them knowledge, to make books so cheap even a peasant might afford them: that is my hope, yes.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head monk: ‘The word of God needs to be interpreted by priests, not spread about like dung.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg: ‘I do not wish to despoil the Word.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head monk: ‘But it will happen. To hand it about to all and sundry is languorous, Would you have ploughmen and weavers debating the Gospel in taverns?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg: ‘If that is what they want to do.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head monk: ‘But what of the dangers? It would be like giving a candle to infants.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg: ‘Such copies we make of the Bible would first be for monasteries and churches.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head monk: ‘The Bible? You plan to make the Bible as well?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg: ‘I have considered it.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/ZTs_mXwMCs8?t=685""&gt;Yannic Kilcher&lt;/a&gt; noticed, it sounds awfully familiar to the opposition to open access to the models today. And then, there were copyists getting put out of their jobs of course.&lt;/p&gt;

Current state of the art is only if the inference is being performed on in-distribution data (so data that is very similar to training data).

You are right that that is more broad than only solved problems, but it is not even necessarily the same as combining known solutions, as long as that combination was novel (in some vague sense of that word) enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are only beginning to scratch the surface on out-of-distribution &amp;quot;learning&amp;quot; (that word should just die as ML is not that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(no known training data, but self generated)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is only good for tasks for which we have well defined outcomes, like games, or even driving. If we have a task of answering a question, that is entirely subjective, as often the question asked is NOT the question that the person wants an answer to.&lt;/p&gt;

"&gt; That is only good for tasks for which we have well defined outcomes

Yes and for that I was thinking, as my starting comment, about code. In code you can test your result.

- does it run within a certain time (no halting problem conondrum) ?
- what does it solves?

And so on.

For example - as you also mentioned for very ""novel"" solutions - I am pretty sure that if GPT-3.5 gets trained on code, also including [age of empires scripted AIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S1CkfzEHSU) - it cannot really generate great AIs that are much different from the known ones because to test the solution of the code it should test the outcome of many matches, and that is not feasible.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-05T20:10:12.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

"Mainstream opinions are aren't based on actual experience with these ""AI"" content generation tools. Opinions are mostly formed based on hand-selected snippets. They assume these examples are what they should expect 100% of the time, with zero effort from the operator. 

But operator bias and skill have a strong influence on these publicly distributed examples, partly though selection bias and partly though skill in prompt crafting. The operator isn't going to post the first thing they generate, a skilled artist will tune the prompt they give their image generation AI and tweak the settings until it produces a result that meets their high expectations, discarding anything that doesn't work. Hell, they often throw the result into Photoshop to clean up any nasty edges.   
As someone without much artistic experience, I find I struggle to make Stable Diffusion produce good results.    

And that's transferable to all content generation AIs. If you want good code results out of github co-pilot, you need to do the same thing. Be a skilled programmer, know it's strengths and weaknesses, iterate on prompts, don't accept any result unless it meets your standards and be prepared to clean it up afterwards. 

It actually goes both ways, someone who hates the idea of content generation AIs will quickly manage to produce examples that prove their point.

"I do not know if you can really apply the analogies onto everything using it though. For example, here's what I got:

&gt; Explain battle of rome like I'm 5, using terms from Pokemon

Response:

&gt;Sure! The battle of Rome was a big fight that happened a long time ago. It was between two groups of people called the Romans and the Barbarians. The Romans were like a team of Pikachu and the Barbarians were like a team of Charizard. The Romans were trying to defend their city, which was like their Pikachu's home, and the Barbarians were trying to take it over. It was a really big and fierce battle, with lots of fire and lightning flying everywhere. In the end, the Romans won and the Barbarians had to go away.

Or another one, ww2 in terms of Frozen:

&gt;Okay! World War II was a really big and scary war that happened a long time ago. It was between two teams of countries, just like how Elsa and Anna were from different places in the movie Frozen. One team was led by a mean and scary queen named Adolf Hitler, who was like the Snow Queen. The other team was made up of lots of different countries who joined together to fight against her, like how Elsa and Anna worked together to defeat the Snow Queen. The war was fought with lots of big, loud, and dangerous weapons, just like how Elsa and Anna used their magical powers to fight the Snow Queen's monsters. In the end, the team of countries led by Adolf Hitler was defeated, and the world was safe again. Just like how Elsa and Anna saved their kingdom from the Snow Queen.","programming","r/programming","2022-12-06T15:27:40.000Z","comment",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not know if you can really apply the analogies onto everything using it though.

"Let's say I want to learn to draw comics. After working through some intro guides, for practice I get a bunch of published Marvel comics and copy them, sometimes making slight changes or mixing up scenes and asking my comic-reading friends to rate my changes.

You commission me to draw a comic on a topic of your choice. I create a draft and send it to you, and we iterate, while you specify different things you'd like to see added or removed so it tells the story you want it to tell. Eventually I make the final version and send it to you, and you publish it and earn some revenue.

Questions for consideration:

1. Who drew the comic?

  a. You

  b. Me

  c. Marvel

2. Legally speaking, who owns the comic?

   a. You

   b. Me

   c. Marvel

3. Who *made* the comic, according to your understand of the word?

  a. You

  b. Me

  c. Marvel

  d. You and me

  e. You and Marvel

  f. Marvel and me

  g. You, me, and Marvel

3. Morally speaking, whose comic is it?

   a. It's my comic. I drew it. You simply provided prompts for me to create the art. Since it's a commission, you own the IP of the comic, but I am the artist.

   b. It's your comic; you had the idea, you shaped the story, you picked out things to be added or removed to suit your vision. While I did the work of drawing it, I was simply acting as your agent and tool.

  c. Both of the above are partially true. While you are responsible for the story and content of the comic, and those are your original creations, the visual art of the comic is my creation, even if you instructed me to add or remove certain elements. Though you hold full rights to it as a work-for-hire, we both share credit for making the comic.

  d. It's Marvel's comic. I developed my comic art skills almost entirely by copying Marvel's existing works, so anything I draw is, by definition, simply a derivative of Marvel's art. You provided some ideas and text, but the visual art is what makes it a comic, and you didn't provide that - at most, you just had me generate Marvel's version of whatever idea you had. While it may legally be your property, that is a failing of the law, because it really belongs to Marvel.

4. Ethically speaking, what is justly due to Marvel in this situation?

   a. Nothing. The comic is my product or our joint product. Since I made it as a work-for-hire, it's fully yours. If you earn revenue by selling it, it belongs to you only. Marvel wasn't involved.

   b. Nothing, but it would be best to thank Marvel in the acknowledgements (alongside your editor, your spouse, your dog, the neighbor who jump-started your car that one time, etc.) as a matter of professional courtesy.

   c. Marvel isn't entitled to any monetary compensation, but because Marvel's existing comics played such a critical role in allowing me to learn the skill, Marvel should be credited with a contributing role at the beginning of the book. I have a duty to provide an exhaustive list of specific Marvel comics that influenced the art in this book. You have a duty to prominently feature this list in the book as prior art.

   d. The book is a derivative product of Marvel's existing art, so Marvel is entitled to a share of revenue. However, since it's not derivative of a specific piece of Marvel art, Marvel doesn't hold copyright, and you're entitled to publish and earn revenue without their prior permission. As with playing recorded music in public, you have to pay a license fee, and Marvel has to accept it.

   e. The book is a derivative product of Marvel's existing art, so Marvel owns it, can fully control how it is distributed, and is entitled to all revenue earned by it. If the law allows you or I to sell and earn revenue from the book without Marvel's permission, the law is unjust.

6. What is the important difference between this hypothetical example and Midjourney?

   a. There's no important difference. This example captures all of the essential concepts to understand the controversy.

   b. Unlike Midjourney, I am an actual person. Since I'm an actual person, I'm inherently capable of creativity and originality in a way that Midjourney is fundamentally not capable of. Assuming I applied my creativity and originality and didn't just copy Marvel works, then I created a creative and original work in the style of Marvel. But if Midjourney were in my position, it would only be capable of producing a derivative of existing Marvel works.

   c. In the example, you play a much more active role. You and I talk about content in a natural and human way, so you can more fully express your ideas for me to realize for you. If I were replaced by Midjourney, you only have a limited ability to influence the specifics of the generated media by changing the prompt. You can't tell Midjourney to include this, don't include that, make this thing more prominent, make that one less prominent; all you can do is change the prompt - often in completely nonsensical ways that have been discovered experimentally by the user community - and hope that it generates a result closer to what you wanted.

   d. Comics are a bad example. Marvel is a for-profit company that makes mass-produced media, aimed at average people. It's hard to draw a ""normal-looking"" superhero comic and not have it look like it was influenced by Marvel's existing comics. That's how comics work. If Midjourney were being used to generate formulaic comics, that would be fine. Real art is crafted by its creator to tell a specific story and evoke deep emotions in viewers. When real art is used as the input of an impersonal algorithm, and its output is claimed to have similar worth to the real art it was given as input, it cheapens the term ""art"". It's offensive because it diminishes the skill of real artists, and dangerous because, by mixing machine-generated media with real art, it threatens the continued existence of art, which is such a vital part of the human experience.

   e. All of the differences are important. Analogies, simplified examples and hypotheticals aren't useful tools for analyzing this topic.

----

The proposed answers to the last question kind of show my issue with the arguments I see on the topic from people who have problems with AI-created visual media.

Like all arguments of the form ""human-created X and AI-created X are fundamentally different because humans and AIs are fundamentally different"", answer b (I am a human, Midjourney isn't) is dangerously close to arguing for the literal existence of souls. If someone wants to actually argue that, then okay. But I don't get the impression that most people who have problems with Midjourney are basing it on metaphysical beliefs.

Answer c (Midjourney prompting is insufficient) is just a technical problem - and one that, if ChatGPT is any indication, is already very close to being resolved. I don't get the impression that most people who have problems with Midjourney will stop having problems if we attach the ChatGPT front-end to it. If anything, I think they'd be even more alarmed!

Answer d (it's fine for Midjourney to create formulaic media, but not real art) is very subjective. People always disagree on what ""real art"" is. I don't get the impression that most people who have problems with Midjourney also want to re-open the ""abstract art isn't *real* art"" debate.

Answer e (analogies and hypotheticals are useless) comes across as rejecting a pretty important philosophical tool because they don't like its implications or don't want to engage with it.
